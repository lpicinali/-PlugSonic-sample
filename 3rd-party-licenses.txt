                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

and conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
(an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - asn1.js@4.10.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# ASN1.js

ASN.1 DER Encoder/Decoder and DSL.

## Example

Define model:

```javascript
var asn = require('asn1.js');

var Human = asn.define('Human', function() {
  this.seq().obj(
    this.key('firstName').octstr(),
    this.key('lastName').octstr(),
    this.key('age').int(),
    this.key('gender').enum({ 0: 'male', 1: 'female' }),
    this.key('bio').seqof(Bio)
  );
});

var Bio = asn.define('Bio', function() {
  this.seq().obj(
    this.key('time').gentime(),
    this.key('description').octstr()
  );
});
```

Encode data:

```javascript
var output = Human.encode({
  firstName: 'Thomas',
  lastName: 'Anderson',
  age: 28,
  gender: 'male',
  bio: [
    {
      time: +new Date('31 March 1999'),
      description: 'freedom of mind'
    }
  ]
}, 'der');
```

Decode data:

```javascript
var human = Human.decode(output, 'der');
console.log(human);
/*
{ firstName: <Buffer 54 68 6f 6d 61 73>,
  lastName: <Buffer 41 6e 64 65 72 73 6f 6e>,
  age: 28,
  gender: 'male',
  bio:
   [ { time: 922820400000,
       description: <Buffer 66 72 65 65 64 6f 6d 20 6f 66 20 6d 69 6e 64> } ] }
*/
```

### Partial decode

Its possible to parse data without stopping on first error. In order to do it,
you should call:

```javascript
var human = Human.decode(output, 'der', { partial: true });
console.log(human);
/*
{ result: { ... },
  errors: [ ... ] }
*/
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - ast-types-flow@0.0.7

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# ast-types-flow

Flow types for the Javascript AST. Based off of [benjamn/ast-types](https://github.com/benjamn/ast-types).

## Usage

First install `ast-types-flow` via npm, then you can import any of the types
that are exported.

```javascript
/* @flow */

import type {Node} from 'ast-types-flow';

function getName(node: Node): string {
  switch (node.type) {
    case 'Identifier':
      return node.name;

    case 'ClassDeclaration':
      return node.id.name; // Error, id could be null.

    case 'FunctionDeclaration':
      return node.id.name; // Fine if it's always there.

    case 'FunctionExpression':
      if (node.id) {
        return node.id.name; // Can refine id to make sure it exists.
      } else {
        return 'Unknown';
      }

    case 'Literal':
      return node.name; // Error, Literals don't have names, don't be silly.
  }
  return 'Unknown';
}
```

## How it works

A notion of "extends" is added to the Flow syntax via comments. A transform is
included that will compile the source code into useful disjoint union types
based on how the different types extend each other. For example:

```javascript
type Node = {
  common: string,
};

type Foo = {
  // extends Node
  foo: string,
};

type Bar = {
  // extends Node
  bar: number,
};
```

Will be transformed into:

```javascript
type Node = {
  type: 'Foo',
  _Foo: void,
  common: string,
  foo: string,
} | {
  type: 'Bar',
  _Bar: void,
  common: string,
  bar: number,
};

type Foo = {
  type: 'Foo',
  _Foo: void,
  common: string,
  foo: string,
};

type Bar = {
  type: 'Bar',
  _Foo: void,
  common: string,
  bar: number,
};
```

A few things to note:

1. The type `Node` would more ideally be compiled into `Foo | Bar` but then the
disjoint union cannot be properly refined. For now we have to duplicate the
complete definitions.
2. Each entry in a disjoint union has to be structurally unique or Flow will
have an error on the definition. That is why the private `_Foo: void` fields
appear in the types.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - async-each@1.0.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# async-each

No-bullshit, ultra-simple, 35-lines-of-code async parallel forEach function for JavaScript.

We don't need junky 30K async libs. Really.

For browsers and node.js.

## Installation
* Just include async-each before your scripts.
* `npm install async-each` if you’re using node.js.
* `bower install async-each` if you’re using [Bower](http://bower.io).

## Usage

* `each(array, iterator, callback);` — `Array`, `Function`, `(optional) Function`
* `iterator(item, next)` receives current item and a callback that will mark the item as done. `next` callback receives optional `error, transformedItem` arguments.
* `callback(error, transformedArray)` optionally receives first error and transformed result `Array`.

Node.js:

```javascript
var each = require('async-each');
each(['a.js', 'b.js', 'c.js'], fs.readFile, function(error, contents) {
  if (error) console.error(error);
  console.log('Contents for a, b and c:', contents);
});
```

Browser:

```javascript
window.asyncEach(list, fn, callback);
```

      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Following is a table of the options you can use:

| Option                   | Default              | Description                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `ast`                    | `true`               | Include the AST in the returned object |
| `auxiliaryCommentAfter`  | `null`               | Attach a comment after all non-user injected code. |
| `auxiliaryCommentBefore` | `null`               | Attach a comment before all non-user injected code. |
| `babelrc`                | `true`               | Specify whether or not to use .babelrc and .babelignore files. Not available when using the CLI, [use `--no-babelrc` instead](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/#babel-ignoring-babelrc). |
| `code`                   | `true`               | Enable code generation |
| `comments`               | `true`               | Output comments in generated output. |
| `compact`                | `"auto"`             | Do not include superfluous whitespace characters and line terminators. When set to `"auto"` compact is set to `true` on input sizes of >500KB. |
| `env`                    | `{}`                 | This is an object of keys that represent different environments. For example, you may have: `{ env: { production: { /* specific options */ } } }` which will use those options when the environment variable `BABEL_ENV` is set to `"production"`. If `BABEL_ENV` isn't set then `NODE_ENV` will be used, if it's not set then it defaults to `"development"` |
| `extends`                | `null`               | A path to an `.babelrc` file to extend |
| `filename`               | `"unknown"`          | Filename for use in errors etc. |
| `filenameRelative`       | `(filename)`         | Filename relative to `sourceRoot`. |
| `generatorOpts`          | `{}`                 | An object containing the options to be passed down to the babel code generator, babel-generator |
| `getModuleId`            | `null`               | Specify a custom callback to generate a module id with. Called as `getModuleId(moduleName)`. If falsy value is returned then the generated module id is used. |
| `highlightCode`          | `true`               | ANSI highlight syntax error code frames |
| `ignore`                 | `null`               | Opposite to the `only` option. `ignore` is disregarded if `only` is specified. |
| `inputSourceMap`         | `null`               | A source map object that the output source map will be based on. |
| `minified`               | `false`              | Should the output be minified (not printing last semicolons in blocks, printing literal string values instead of escaped ones, stripping `()` from `new` when safe) |
| `moduleId`               | `null`               | Specify a custom name for module ids. |
| `moduleIds`              | `false`              | If truthy, insert an explicit id for modules. By default, all modules are anonymous. (Not available for `common` modules) |
| `moduleRoot`             | `(sourceRoot)`       | Optional prefix for the AMD module formatter that will be prepend to the filename on module definitions. |
| `only`                   | `null`               | A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch), regex, or mixed array of both, matching paths to **only** compile. Can also be an array of arrays containing paths to explicitly match. When attempting to compile a non-matching file it's returned verbatim. |
| `parserOpts`             | `{}`                 | An object containing the options to be passed down to the babel parser, babylon |
| `plugins`                | `[]`                 | List of [plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/) to load and use. |
| `presets`                | `[]`                 | List of [presets](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#presets) (a set of plugins) to load and use. |
| `retainLines`            | `false`              | Retain line numbers. This will lead to wacky code but is handy for scenarios where you can't use source maps. (**NOTE:** This will not retain the columns) |
| `resolveModuleSource`    | `null`               | Resolve a module source ie. `import "SOURCE";` to a custom value. Called as `resolveModuleSource(source, filename)`. |
| `shouldPrintComment`     | `null`               | An optional callback that controls whether a comment should be output or not. Called as `shouldPrintComment(commentContents)`. **NOTE:** This overrides the `comment` option when used. |
| `sourceFileName`         | `(filenameRelative)` | Set `sources[0]` on returned source map. |
| `sourceMaps`             | `false`              | If truthy, adds a `map` property to returned output. If set to `"inline"`, a comment with a sourceMappingURL directive is added to the bottom of the returned code. If set to `"both"` then a `map` property is returned as well as a source map comment appended. **This does not emit sourcemap files by itself!** To have sourcemaps emitted using the CLI, you must pass it the `--source-maps` option. |
| `sourceMapTarget`        | `(filenameRelative)` | Set `file` on returned source map. |
| `sourceRoot`             | `(moduleRoot)`       | The root from which all sources are relative. |
| `sourceType`             | `"module"`           | Indicate the mode the code should be parsed in. Can be either "script" or "module". |
| `wrapPluginVisitorMethod`| `null`               | An optional callback that can be used to wrap visitor methods. **NOTE:** This is useful for things like introspection, and not really needed for implementing anything. Called as `wrapPluginVisitorMethod(pluginAlias, visitorType, callback)`.

## Options

Options for formatting output:

name                   | type     | default         | description
-----------------------|----------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
auxiliaryCommentBefore | string   |                 | Optional string to add as a block comment at the start of the output file
auxiliaryCommentAfter  | string   |                 | Optional string to add as a block comment at the end of the output file
shouldPrintComment     | function | `opts.comments` | Function that takes a comment (as a string) and returns `true` if the comment should be included in the output.  By default, comments are included if `opts.comments` is `true` or if `opts.minifed` is `false` and the comment contains `@preserve` or `@license`
retainLines            | boolean  | `false`         | Attempt to use the same line numbers in the output code as in the source code (helps preserve stack traces)
retainFunctionParens   | boolean  | `false`         | Retain parens around function expressions (could be used to change engine parsing behavior)
comments               | boolean  | `true`          | Should comments be included in output
compact                | boolean or `'auto'` | `opts.minified` | Set to `true` to avoid adding whitespace for formatting
minified               | boolean  | `false`         | Should the output be minified
concise                | boolean  | `false`         | Set to `true` to reduce whitespace (but not as much as `opts.compact`)
quotes                 | `'single'` or `'double'` | autodetect based on `ast.tokens` | The type of quote to use in the output
filename               | string   |                 | Used in warning messages
flowCommaSeparator     | boolean  | `false`         | Set to `true` to use commas instead of semicolons as Flow property separators
jsonCompatibleStrings  | boolean  | `false`         | Set to true to run `jsesc` with "json": true to print "\u00A9" vs. "©";

Options for source maps:

name                   | type     | default         | description
-----------------------|----------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
sourceMaps             | boolean  | `false`         | Enable generating source maps
sourceMapTarget        | string   |                 | The filename of the generated code that the source map will be associated with
sourceRoot             | string   |                 | A root for all relative URLs in the source map
sourceFileName         | string   |                 | The filename for the source code (i.e. the code in the `code` argument).  This will only be used if `code` is a string.

## AST from Multiple Sources

In most cases, Babel does a 1:1 transformation of input-file to output-file.  However,
you may be dealing with AST constructed from multiple sources - JS files, templates, etc.
If this is the case, and you want the sourcemaps to reflect the correct sources, you'll need
to pass an object to `generate` as the `code` parameter.  Keys
should be the source filenames, and values should be the source content.

Here's an example of what that might look like:

```js
import {parse} from 'babylon';
import generate from 'babel-generator';

const a = 'var a = 1;';
const b = 'var b = 2;';
const astA = parse(a, { sourceFilename: 'a.js' });
const astB = parse(b, { sourceFilename: 'b.js' });
const ast = {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [].concat(astA.program.body, astB.program.body)
};

const { code, map } = generate(ast, { sourceMaps: true }, {
  'a.js': a,
  'b.js': b
});

// Sourcemap will point to both a.js and b.js where appropriate.
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - babel-jest@20.0.3

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# babel-jest

[Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) plugin

## Usage

If you are already using `jest-cli`, just add `babel-jest` and it will automatically compile JavaScript code using babel.

```
npm install --save-dev babel-jest
```

If you would like to write your own preprocessor, uninstall and delete babel-jest and set the [config.transform](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/configuration.html#transform-object-string-string) option to your preprocessor.

## Setup

*Note: this step is only required if you are using `babel-jest` with additional code preprocessors.*

To explicitly define `babel-jest` as a transformer for your JavaScript code, map *.js* files to the `babel-jest` module.

```json
"transform": {
  "^.+\\.jsx?$": "babel-jest"
},
```

Compile trailing function commas to ES5


```js
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
);
```
[Try in REPL](http://babeljs.io/repl/#?evaluate=true&presets=es2015%2Cstage-0&code=function%20clownPuppiesEverywhere(%0A%20%20param1%2C%0A%20%20param2%2C%0A)%20%7B%20%2F*%20...%20*%2F%20%7D%0A%0AclownPuppiesEverywhere(%0A%20%20'foo'%2C%0A%20%20'bar'%2C%0A)%3B)

## Example

### Basic
This is an example from the [Proposal](https://github.com/jeffmo/es-trailing-function-commas).

Let's say you have this function:

```js
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar'
);
```

If you want to have a new parameter called `param3`, the diff output would be like that:

```diff
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
- param2
+ param2, // Change this line to add a comma
+ param3  // Add param3
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
- 'bar'
+ 'bar', // Change this line to add a comma
+ 'baz'  // Add param3
);
```
In total, you have to change 2 lines for the function declaration and 2 lines for each usage.

If you had your function defined with trailing commas:

```js
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
);
```
Adding a new parameter would only change one line in the function declaration and one line for each usage:

```diff
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
+ param3, // Add param3
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
+ 'baz', // Add param3
);
```
In the end, your diff output will be cleaner and easier to read, it would be much quicker to add a new parameter to your functions, it also makes it easier to copy paste elements and move code around.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - babel-plugin-transform-class-properties@6.24.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# babel-plugin-transform-class-properties

> This plugin transforms es2015 static class properties as well as properties declared with the es2016 property initializer syntax.

## Example

Below is a class with four class properties which will be transformed.

```js
  class Bork {
    //Property initializer syntax
    instanceProperty = "bork";
    boundFunction = () => {
      return this.instanceProperty;
    }

    //Static class properties
    static staticProperty = "babelIsCool";
    static staticFunction = function() {
      return Bork.staticProperty;
    }
  }

  let myBork = new Bork;

  //Property initializers are not on the prototype.
  console.log(myBork.prototype.boundFunction); // > undefined

  //Bound functions are bound to the class instance.
  console.log(myBork.boundFunction.call(undefined)); // > "bork"

  //Static function exists on the class.
  console.log(Bork.staticFunction()); // > "babelIsCool"
```


## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-class-properties
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```json
// without options
{
  "plugins": ["transform-class-properties"]
}

// with options
{
  "plugins": [
    ["transform-class-properties", { "spec": true }]
  ]
}
```

### Via CLI

```sh
babel --plugins transform-class-properties script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("babel-core").transform("code", {
  plugins: ["transform-class-properties"]
});
```

## Options

### `spec`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

Class properties are compiled to use `Object.defineProperty`. Static fields are now defined even if they are not initialized.

npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-es2015-arrow-functions
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```js
// without options
{
  "plugins": ["transform-es2015-arrow-functions"]
}

// with options
{
  "plugins": [

```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("babel-core").transform("code", {
  plugins: ["transform-es2015-arrow-functions"]
});
```

## Options

* `spec` - This option wraps the generated function in `.bind(this)` and keeps uses of `this` inside the function as-is, instead of using a renamed `this`. It also adds a runtime check to ensure the functions are not instantiated.

}
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - babel-plugin-transform-es2015-block-scoping@6.26.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# babel-plugin-transform-es2015-block-scoping

> Compile ES2015 block scoping (const and let) to ES5

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-es2015-block-scoping
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

Without options:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["transform-es2015-block-scoping"]
}
```

With options:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["transform-es2015-block-scoping", {
      "throwIfClosureRequired": true
    }]
  ]
}
```

### Via CLI

```sh
babel --plugins transform-es2015-block-scoping script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("babel-core").transform("code", {
  plugins: ["transform-es2015-block-scoping"]
});
```

## Options `throwIfClosureRequired`

In cases such as the following it's impossible to rewrite let/const without adding an additional function and closure while transforming:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
}
```

In extremely performance-sensitive code, this can be undesirable. If `"throwIfClosureRequired": true` is set, Babel throws when transforming these patterns instead of automatically adding an additional function.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - babel-plugin-transform-es2015-classes@6.24.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# babel-plugin-transform-es2015-classes

> Compile ES2015 classes to ES5

## Caveats

Built-in classes such as `Date`, `Array`, `DOM` etc cannot be properly subclassed
due to limitations in ES5 (for the [es2015-classes](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-es2015-classes) plugin).
You can try to use [babel-plugin-transform-builtin-extend](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-builtin-extend) based on `Object.setPrototypeOf` and `Reflect.construct`, but it also has some limitations.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-es2015-classes
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```js
// without options
{
  "plugins": ["transform-es2015-classes"]
}

// with options
{
  "plugins": [
    ["transform-es2015-classes", {
      "loose": true
    }]
  ]
}
```

### Via CLI

```sh
babel --plugins transform-es2015-classes script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("babel-core").transform("code", {
  plugins: ["transform-es2015-classes"]
});
```

## Options

### `loose`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

#### Method enumerability

Please note that in loose mode class methods **are** enumerable. This is not in line
with the spec and you may run into issues.

#### Method assignment

Under loose mode, methods are defined on the class prototype with simple assignments
instead of being defined. This can result in the following not working:

```javascript
class Foo {
  set bar() {
    throw new Error("foo!");
  }
}

class Bar extends Foo {
  bar() {
    // will throw an error when this method is defined
  }
}
```

When `Bar.prototype.foo` is defined it triggers the setter on `Foo`. This is a
case that is very unlikely to appear in production code however it's something
to keep in mind.

 - babel-plugin-transform-es2015-computed-properties@6.24.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# babel-plugin-transform-es2015-computed-properties

> Compile ES2015 computed properties to ES5

## Example

**In**

```js
var obj = {
  ["x" + foo]: "heh",
  ["y" + bar]: "noo",
  foo: "foo",
  bar: "bar"
};
```

**Out**

```js
var _obj;

function _defineProperty(obj, key, value) {
  if (key in obj) {
    Object.defineProperty(obj, key, {
      value: value,
      enumerable: true,
      configurable: true,
      writable: true
    });
  } else {

  _defineProperty(_obj, "bar", "bar"),
  _obj
);
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-es2015-computed-properties
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

Without options:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["transform-es2015-computed-properties"]
}
```

With options:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["transform-es2015-computed-properties", {
      "loose": true
    }]
  ]
}
```

### Via CLI

```sh
babel --plugins transform-es2015-computed-properties script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("babel-core").transform("code", {
  plugins: ["transform-es2015-computed-properties"]
});
```

## Options

### `loose`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`

Just like method assignment in classes, in loose mode, computed property names
use simple assignments instead of being defined. This is unlikely to be an issue
in production code.

#### Example

***In***

```js
var obj = {
  ["x" + foo]: "heh",
  ["y" + bar]: "noo",
  foo: "foo",
  bar: "bar"
};
```

***Out***

```js
var _obj;

var obj = (
  _obj = {},
  _obj["x" + foo] = "heh",
  _obj["y" + bar] = "noo",
  _obj.foo = "foo",
  _obj.bar = "bar",
  _obj
);
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - babel-plugin-transform-es2015-duplicate-keys@6.24.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# babel-plugin-transform-es2015-duplicate-keys

> Compile objects with duplicate keys to valid strict ES5.

This plugin actually converts duplicate keys in objects to be computed properties, which then must be handled by the [transform-es2015-computed-properties](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-es2015-computed-properties) plugin. The final result won't contain any object literals with duplicate keys.

## Example

**In**

```javascript
var x = { a: 5, a: 6 };
var y = {
  get a() {},
  set a(x) {},
  a: 3
};
```

**Out**

```javascript
var x = { a: 5, ["a"]: 6 };
var y = {
  get a() {},
  set a(x) {},
  ["a"]: 3
};
```

> Compile ES2015 for...of to ES5

## Example

**In**

```js
for (var i of foo) {}
```

**Out**

```js
var _iteratorNormalCompletion = true;
var _didIteratorError = false;
var _iteratorError = undefined;

try {
  for (var _iterator = foo[Symbol.iterator](), _step; !(_iteratorNormalCompletion = (_step = _iterator.next()).done); _iteratorNormalCompletion = true) {
    var i = _step.value;
  }
} catch (err) {
  _didIteratorError = true;
  _iteratorError = err;
} finally {
  try {
    if (!_iteratorNormalCompletion && _iterator.return) {
      _iterator.return();
    }
  } finally {
    if (_didIteratorError) {
      throw _iteratorError;
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation

npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-es2015-for-of
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```js
// without options
{
  "plugins": ["transform-es2015-for-of"]
}

// with options
{
  "plugins": [
    ["transform-es2015-for-of", {
      "loose": true
    }]
  ]

babel --plugins transform-es2015-for-of script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("babel-core").transform("code", {
  plugins: ["transform-es2015-for-of"]
});
```

## Options

### `loose`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`

In loose mode, arrays are put in a fast path, thus heavily increasing performance.
All other iterables will continue to work fine.

#### Example

**In**

```js
for (var i of foo) {}
```

**Out**

```js
for (var _iterator = foo, _isArray = Array.isArray(_iterator), _i = 0, _iterator = _isArray ? _iterator : _iterator[Symbol.iterator]();;) {
  var _ref;

  if (_isArray) {
    if (_i >= _iterator.length) break;
    _ref = _iterator[_i++];
  } else {
    _i = _iterator.next();
    if (_i.done) break;
    _ref = _i.value;
  }

  var i = _ref;
}
```

#### Abrupt completions

In loose mode an iterator's `return` method will not be called on abrupt completions caused by thrown errors.

Please see [google/traceur-compiler#1773](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/issues/1773) and
[babel/babel#838](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/838) for more information.

### Optimization

If a basic array is used, Babel will compile the for-of loop down to a regular for loop.

**In**

```js
for (let a of [1,2,3]) {}
```

**Out**

```js
var _arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (var _i = 0; _i < _arr.length; _i++) {
  var a = _arr[_i];
}
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs@6.26.2

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs

> This plugin transforms ES2015 modules to [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1).
>
> #### Babel 6 Changes
> 
> Babel 6 changed some behavior by not doing `module.exports = exports['default']` anymore in the modules transforms.
> 
> There are some caveats, but you can use [babel-plugin-add-module-exports](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-add-module-exports), so that updating to Babel 6 isn't a breaking change since users that don't use ES modules don't have to do `require("your-module").default`.
> 
> However, it may not match how Node eventually implements ES modules natively given the [the current proposal](https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/blob/master/002-es-modules.md#46-es-consuming-commonjs).

## Example

**In**

```javascript
export default 42;
```

**Out**

```javascript
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", {
  value: true
});

exports.default = 42;
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```js
// without options
{
  "plugins": ["transform-es2015-modules-commonjs"]
}

// with options
{
  "plugins": [
    ["transform-es2015-modules-commonjs", {
      "allowTopLevelThis": true
    }]
  ]
}
```

### Via CLI

```sh
babel --plugins transform-es2015-modules-commonjs script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("babel-core").transform("code", {
  plugins: ["transform-es2015-modules-commonjs"]
});
```

## Options

### `loose`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

As per the spec, `import` and `export` are only allowed to be used at the top
level. When in loose mode these are allowed to be used anywhere.

And by default, when using exports with babel a non-enumerable `__esModule` property
is exported.

```javascript
var foo = exports.foo = 5;

Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", {
  value: true
});
```

In environments that don't support this you can enable loose mode on `babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs`
and instead of using `Object.defineProperty` an assignment will be used instead.

```javascript
var foo = exports.foo = 5;
exports.__esModule = true;
```

### `strict`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`

By default, when using exports with babel a non-enumerable `__esModule` property
is exported. In some cases this property is used to determine if the import _is_ the
default export or if it _contains_ the default export.

```javascript
var foo = exports.foo = 5;

Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", {
  value: true
});
```

In order to prevent the `__esModule` property from being exported, you can set
the `strict` option to `true`.

### `noInterop`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`

By default, when using exports with babel a non-enumerable `__esModule` property
is exported. This property is then used to determine if the import _is_ the default
export or if it _contains_ the default export.

```javascript
"use strict";

var _foo = require("foo");

var _foo2 = _interopRequireDefault(_foo);

function _interopRequireDefault(obj) {
  return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj };
}
```

In cases where the auto-unwrapping of `default` is not needed, you can set the
`noInterop` option to `true` to avoid the usage of the `interopRequireDefault`
helper (shown in inline form above).

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-umd@6.24.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-umd

> This plugin transforms ES2015 modules to [Universal Module Definition (UMD)](https://github.com/umdjs/umd).

## Example

**In**

```javascript
export default 42;
```

**Out**

```javascript
(function (global, factory) {
  if (typeof define === "function" && define.amd) {
    define(["exports"], factory);
  } else if (typeof exports !== "undefined") {
    factory(exports);
  } else {
    var mod = {
      exports: {}
    };
    factory(mod.exports);
    global.actual = mod.exports;
  }
})(this, function (exports) {
  "use strict";

  Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", {
    value: true
  });

  exports.default = 42;
});
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-umd
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "plugins": ["transform-es2015-modules-umd"]
}
```

You can also override the names of particular libraries when this module is
running in the browser.  For example the `es6-promise` library exposes itself
as `global.Promise` rather than `global.es6Promise`. This can be accommodated by:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["transform-es2015-modules-umd", {
      "globals": {
        "es6-promise": "Promise"
      }
    }]
  ]
}
```

#### Default semantics

There are a few things to note about the default semantics.

_First_, this transform uses the
[basename](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basename) of each import to generate
the global names in the UMD output. This means that if you're importing
multiple modules with the same basename, like:

```js
import fooBar1 from "foo-bar";
import fooBar2 from "./mylib/foo-bar";
```

it will transpile into two references to the same browser global:

```js
factory(global.fooBar, global.fooBar);
```

If you set the plugin options to:

```json
{
  "globals": {
    "foo-bar": "fooBAR",
    "./mylib/foo-bar": "mylib.fooBar"
  }
}
```

it will still transpile both to one browser global:

```js
factory(global.fooBAR, global.fooBAR);
```

because again the transform is only using the basename of the import.

_Second_, the specified override will still be passed to the `toIdentifier`
function in [babel-types/src/converters](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-types/src/converters.js).
This means that if you specify an override as a member expression like:

```json
{
  "globals": {
    "fizzbuzz": "fizz.buzz"
  }
}
```

this will _not_ transpile to `factory(global.fizz.buzz)`. Instead, it will
transpile to `factory(global.fizzBuzz)` based on the logic in `toIdentifier`.

_Third_, you cannot override the exported global name.

#### More flexible semantics with `exactGlobals: true`

All of these behaviors can limit the flexibility of the `globals` map. To
remove these limitations, you can set the `exactGlobals` option to `true`.
Doing this instructs the plugin to:

1. always use the full import string instead of the basename when generating
the global names
2. skip passing `globals` overrides to the `toIdentifier` function. Instead,
they are used exactly as written, so you will get errors if you do not use
valid identifiers or valid uncomputed (dot) member expressions.
3. allow the exported global name to be overridden via the `globals` map. Any
override must again be a valid identifier or valid member expression.

Thus, if you set `exactGlobals` to `true` and do not pass any overrides, the
first example of:

```js
import fooBar1 from "foo-bar";
import fooBar2 from "./mylib/foo-bar";
```

will transpile to:

```js
factory(global.fooBar, global.mylibFooBar);
```

And if you set the plugin options to:

```json
{
  "globals": {
    "foo-bar": "fooBAR",
    "./mylib/foo-bar": "mylib.fooBar"
  },
  "exactGlobals": true
}
```

then it'll transpile to:

```js
factory(global.fooBAR, global.mylib.fooBar)
```

Finally, with the plugin options set to:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "external-helpers",
    ["transform-es2015-modules-umd", {
      "globals": {
        "my/custom/module/name": "My.Custom.Module.Name"
      },
      "exactGlobals": true
    }]
  ],
  "moduleId": "my/custom/module/name"
}
```

it will transpile to:

```js
factory(mod.exports);
global.My = global.My || {};
global.My.Custom = global.My.Custom || {};
global.My.Custom.Module = global.My.Custom.Module || {};
global.My.Custom.Module.Name = mod.exports;
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - babel-plugin-transform-runtime@6.23.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# babel-plugin-transform-runtime

> Externalise references to helpers and builtins, automatically polyfilling your code without polluting globals. (This plugin is recommended in a library/tool)

NOTE: Instance methods such as `"foobar".includes("foo")` will not work since that would require modification of existing builtins (Use [`babel-polyfill`](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill) for that).

## Why?

Babel uses very small helpers for common functions such as `_extend`. By default this will be added to every file that requires it. This duplication is sometimes unnecessary, especially when your application is spread out over multiple files.

This is where the `transform-runtime` plugin comes in: all of the helpers will reference the module `babel-runtime` to avoid duplication across your compiled output. The runtime will be compiled into your build.

Another purpose of this transformer is to create a sandboxed environment for your code. If you use [babel-polyfill](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) and the built-ins it provides such as `Promise`, `Set` and `Map`, those will pollute the global scope. While this might be ok for an app or a command line tool, it becomes a problem if your code is a library which you intend to publish for others to use or if you can't exactly control the environment in which your code will run.

The transformer will alias these built-ins to `core-js` so you can use them seamlessly without having to require the polyfill.

See the [technical details](#technical-details) section for more information on how this works and the types of transformations that occur.

## Installation

**NOTE - Production vs. development dependencies**

In most cases, you should install `babel-plugin-transform-runtime` as a development dependency (with `--save-dev`).

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-runtime
```

and `babel-runtime` as a production dependency (with `--save`).

```sh
npm install --save babel-runtime
```

The transformation plugin is typically used only in development, but the runtime itself will be depended on by your deployed/published code. See the examples below for more details.

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

Add the following line to your `.babelrc` file:

```js
// without options
{
  "plugins": ["transform-runtime"]
}

// with options
{
  "plugins": [
    ["transform-runtime", {
      "helpers": false, // defaults to true
      "polyfill": false, // defaults to true
      "regenerator": true, // defaults to true
      "moduleName": "babel-runtime" // defaults to "babel-runtime"
    }]
  ]
}
```

### Via CLI

```sh
babel --plugins transform-runtime script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("babel-core").transform("code", {
  plugins: ["transform-runtime"]
});
```

## Technical details

The `runtime` transformer plugin does three things:

* Automatically requires `babel-runtime/regenerator` when you use generators/async functions.
* Automatically requires `babel-runtime/core-js` and maps ES6 static methods and built-ins.
* Removes the inline babel helpers and uses the module `babel-runtime/helpers` instead.

What does this actually mean though? Basically, you can use built-ins such as `Promise`, `Set`, `Symbol` etc as well use all the Babel features that require a polyfill seamlessly, without global pollution, making it extremely suitable for libraries.

Make sure you include `babel-runtime` as a dependency.

### Regenerator aliasing

Whenever you use a generator function or async function:

```javascript
function* foo() {

}
```

the following is generated:

```javascript
"use strict";

var _marked = [foo].map(regeneratorRuntime.mark);

function foo() {
  return regeneratorRuntime.wrap(function foo$(_context) {
    while (1) switch (_context.prev = _context.next) {
      case 0:
      case "end":
        return _context.stop();
    }
  }, _marked[0], this);
}
```

This isn't ideal as then you have to include the regenerator runtime which
pollutes the global scope.

Instead what the `runtime` transformer does it compile that to:

```javascript
"use strict";

var _regenerator = require("babel-runtime/regenerator");

var _regenerator2 = _interopRequireDefault(_regenerator);

function _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }

var _marked = [foo].map(_regenerator2.default.mark);

function foo() {
  return regeneratorRuntime.wrap(function foo$(_context) {
    while (1) switch (_context.prev = _context.next) {
      case 0:
      case "end":
        return _context.stop();
    }
  }, _marked[0], this);
}
```

This means that you can use the regenerator runtime without polluting your current environment.

### `core-js` aliasing

Sometimes you may want to use new built-ins such as `Map`, `Set`, `Promise` etc. Your only way
to use these is usually to include a globally polluting polyfill.

What the `runtime` transformer does is transform the following:

```javascript
var sym = Symbol();

var promise = new Promise;

console.log(arr[Symbol.iterator]());
```

into the following:

```javascript
"use strict";

var _getIterator2 = require("babel-runtime/core-js/get-iterator");

var _getIterator3 = _interopRequireDefault(_getIterator2);

var _promise = require("babel-runtime/core-js/promise");

var _promise2 = _interopRequireDefault(_promise);

var _symbol = require("babel-runtime/core-js/symbol");

var _symbol2 = _interopRequireDefault(_symbol);

function _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }

var sym = (0, _symbol2.default)();

var promise = new _promise2.default();

console.log((0, _getIterator3.default)(arr));
```

This means is that you can seamlessly use these native built-ins and static methods
without worrying about where they come from.

**NOTE:** Instance methods such as `"foobar".includes("foo")` will **not** work.

### Helper aliasing

Usually babel will place helpers at the top of your file to do common tasks to avoid
duplicating the code around in the current file. Sometimes these helpers can get a
little bulky and add unnecessary duplication across files. The `runtime`
transformer replaces all the helper calls to a module.

That means that the following code:

```javascript
class Person {
}
```

usually turns into:

```javascript
"use strict";

function _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError("Cannot call a class as a function"); } }

var Person = function Person() {
  _classCallCheck(this, Person);
};
```

the `runtime` transformer however turns this into:

```javascript
"use strict";

var _classCallCheck2 = require("babel-runtime/helpers/classCallCheck");

var _classCallCheck3 = _interopRequireDefault(_classCallCheck2);

function _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }

var Person = function Person() {
  (0, _classCallCheck3.default)(this, Person);
};
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - babel-preset-react-app@3.1.2

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# babel-preset-react-app

This package includes the Babel preset used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).<br>
Please refer to its documentation:

* [Getting Started](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) – How to create a new app.
* [User Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Usage in Create React App Projects

The easiest way to use this configuration is with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which includes it by default. **You don’t need to install it separately in Create React App projects.**

## Usage Outside of Create React App

If you want to use this Babel preset in a project not built with Create React App, you can install it with following steps.

First, [install Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/).

Then install babel-preset-react-app.

```sh
npm install babel-preset-react-app --save-dev
```

Then create a file named `.babelrc` with following contents in the root folder of your project:

  ```js
  {
    "presets": ["react-app"]
  }
  ```

This preset uses the `useBuiltIns` option with [transform-object-rest-spread](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-rest-spread/) and [transform-react-jsx](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-jsx/), which assumes that `Object.assign` is available or polyfilled.

-----------

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - babel-preset-react@6.24.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

echo '{ "presets": ["react"] }' > .babelrc
```

Create a file to run on

```sh
echo '<h1>Hello, world!</h1>' > index.js
```

View the output

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/babel index.js
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "presets": ["react"]
}
```

### Via CLI

babel script.js --presets react 
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("babel-core").transform("code", {
  presets: ["react"]
});
```

-----------

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - babel-register@6.26.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# babel-register

> The require hook will bind itself to node's require and automatically compile files on the fly.

One of the ways you can use Babel is through the require hook. The require hook
will bind itself to node's `require` and automatically compile files on the
fly. This is equivalent to CoffeeScript's
[coffee-script/register](http://coffeescript.org/v2/annotated-source/register.html).

## Install

```sh
npm install babel-register --save-dev
```

## Usage

```js
require("babel-register");
```

All subsequent files required by node with the extensions `.es6`, `.es`, `.jsx`
and `.js` will be transformed by Babel.

<blockquote class="babel-callout babel-callout-info">
  <h4>Polyfill not included</h4>
  <p>
    You must include the <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/">polyfill</a> separately
    when using features that require it, like generators.
  </p>
</blockquote>

### Ignores `node_modules` by default

**NOTE:** By default all requires to `node_modules` will be ignored. You can
override this by passing an ignore regex via:

```js
require("babel-register")({
  // This will override `node_modules` ignoring - you can alternatively pass
  // an array of strings to be explicitly matched or a regex / glob
  ignore: false
});
```

## Specifying options

```javascript
require("babel-register")({
  // Optional ignore regex - if any filenames **do** match this regex then they
  // aren't compiled.
  ignore: /regex/,

  // Ignore can also be specified as a function.
  ignore: function(filename) {
    if (filename === "/path/to/es6-file.js") {
      return false;
    } else {
      return true;
    }
  },

  // Optional only regex - if any filenames **don't** match this regex then they
  // aren't compiled
  only: /my_es6_folder/,

  // Setting this will remove the currently hooked extensions of .es6, `.es`, `.jsx`
  // and .js so you'll have to add them back if you want them to be used again.
  extensions: [".es6", ".es", ".jsx", ".js"],

  // Setting this to false will disable the cache.
  cache: true
});
```

You can pass in all other [options](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/api/#options) as well,
including `plugins` and `presets`. But note that the closest [`.babelrc`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/)
to each file still applies, and takes precedence over any options you pass in here.

## Environment variables

By default `babel-node` and `babel-register` will save to a json cache in your
temporary directory.

This will heavily improve with the startup and compilation of your files. There
are however scenarios where you want to change this behaviour and there are
environment variables exposed to allow you to do this.

### BABEL_CACHE_PATH

Specify a different cache location.

```sh
BABEL_CACHE_PATH=/foo/my-cache.json babel-node script.js
```

### BABEL_DISABLE_CACHE

Disable the cache.

```sh
BABEL_DISABLE_CACHE=1 babel-node script.js
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - babel-template@6.26.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# babel-template

> Generate an AST from a string template.

In computer science, this is known as an implementation of quasiquotes.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-template
```

## Usage

```js
import template from "babel-template";
import generate from "babel-generator";
import * as t from "babel-types";

const buildRequire = template(`
  var IMPORT_NAME = require(SOURCE);
`);

const ast = buildRequire({
  IMPORT_NAME: t.identifier("myModule"),
  SOURCE: t.stringLiteral("my-module")
});

console.log(generate(ast).code);
```

```js
const myModule = require("my-module");
```

## API

### `template(code, [opts])`

#### code

Type: `string`

#### options

`babel-template` accepts all of the options from [babylon], and specifies
some defaults of its own:

* `allowReturnOutsideFunction` is set to `true` by default.
* `allowSuperOutsideMethod` is set to `true` by default.

##### preserveComments

Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

Set this to `true` to preserve any comments from the `code` parameter.

#### Return value

`babel-template` returns a `function` which is invoked with an optional object
of replacements. See the usage section for an example.

# babel-traverse

> babel-traverse maintains the overall tree state, and is responsible for replacing, removing, and adding nodes.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save babel-traverse
```

## Usage

We can use it alongside Babylon to traverse and update nodes:

```js
import * as babylon from "babylon";
import traverse from "babel-traverse";

const code = `function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}`;

const ast = babylon.parse(code);

traverse(ast, {
  enter(path) {
    if (path.isIdentifier({ name: "n" })) {
      path.node.name = "x";
    }
  }
});
```

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# <img src="./logo.png" alt="bn.js" width="160" height="160" />

> BigNum in pure javascript

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)

## Install
`npm install --save bn.js`

## Usage

```js
const BN = require('bn.js');

var a = new BN('dead', 16);
var b = new BN('101010', 2);

var res = a.add(b);
console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047
```

**Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.

## Notation

### Prefixes

There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here
is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:

* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on
  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs
* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or
  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations
  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be
  added to the result to make it positive

### Postfixes

The only available postfix at the moment is:

* `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript
  Number. Decimals are not supported.

### Examples

* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`
* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value
* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13

## Instructions

Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be
either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).

### Utilities

* `a.clone()` - clone number
* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes
* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)
* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)
* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero
  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding
* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,
  which must behave like an `Array`
* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For
  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:
  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`
* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied
* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits
  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)
* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied
* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative
* `a.isEven()` - no comments
* `a.isOdd()` - no comments
* `a.isZero()` - no comments
* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)
  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)
* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)
* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)
* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width
* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width
* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance

### Arithmetics

* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)
* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)
* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)
* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`
* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)
* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)
* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division

### Bit operations

* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced
  with `andn` in future)
* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`
* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set
* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)
* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number
* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)

### Reduction

* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD
* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)
* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`

## Fast reduction

When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to
use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm
for [Mersenne Prime][1].

### Reduction context

To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:

```js
var red = BN.red(num);
```
where `num` is just a BN instance.

Or:

```js
var red = BN.red(primeName);
```

Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:

* `'k256'`
* `'p224'`
* `'p192'`
* `'p25519'`

Or:

```js
var red = BN.mont(num);
```

To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than
`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.

### Converting numbers

Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted
to it. Usually, this means that one should:

* Convert inputs to reducted ones
* Operate on them in reduction context
* Convert outputs back from the reduction context

Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:

```js
var redA = a.toRed(red);
```
Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above

Here is how to convert them back:

```js
var a = redA.fromRed();
```

### Red instructions

Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their
counterparts in red context:

* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`
* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`
* `a.redShl(num)`
* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`
* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`
* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime
* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number
* `a.redNeg()`
* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation

#boolbase
This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).

###WTF?

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.

###And why is this a separate module?

I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

# caller-path [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/caller-path.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/caller-path)

> Get the path of the caller module

You can't use [`module.parent`](http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_parent) as modules are cached and it will return the first caller module, not necessarily the current one.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save caller-path
```


## Usage

```js
// foo.js
var callerPath = require('caller-path');

module.exports = function () {
	console.log(callerPath());
	//=> /Users/sindresorhus/dev/unicorn/bar.js
}
```

```js
// bar.js
var foo = require('./foo');
foo();

## Usage

```js
var callsites = require('callsites');

function unicorn() {
	console.log(callsites()[0].getFileName());
	//=> /Users/sindresorhus/dev/callsites/test.js
}

unicorn();
```

## API

Returns an array of callsite objects with the following methods:

- `getThis`: returns the value of this
- `getTypeName`: returns the type of this as a string. This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of this, if available, otherwise the object's [[Class]] internal property.
- `getFunction`: returns the current function
- `getFunctionName`: returns the name of the current function, typically its name property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function's context.
- `getMethodName`: returns the name of the property of this or one of its prototypes that holds the current function
- `getFileName`: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script
- `getLineNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number
- `getColumnNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number
- `getEvalOrigin`: if this function was created using a call to eval returns a CallSite object representing the location where eval was called
- `isToplevel`: is this a toplevel invocation, that is, is this the global object?
- `isEval`: does this call take place in code defined by a call to eval?
- `isNative`: is this call in native V8 code?
- `isConstructor`: is this a constructor call?

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
     for the public:

     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,

     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of

     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,

     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws

     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the

     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically

               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT

change-emitter
==============

[![build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/acdlite/change-emitter/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/acdlite/change-emitter)
[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/change-emitter.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/change-emitter)

Listen for changes. Like an event emitter that only emits a single event type. Really tiny.

I extracted this from Redux's `createStore()` because I found it to be useful in other contexts. Use it where you want the most minimal event subscription implementation possible.

## Usage

```js
import { createChangeEmitter } from 'change-emitter'

const emitter = createChangeEmitter()

// Called `listen` instead of `subscribe` to avoid confusion with observable spec
const unlisten = emitter.listen((...args) => {
  console.log(args)
})

emitter.emit(1, 2, 3) // logs `[1, 2, 3]`
unlisten()
emitter.emit(4, 5, 6) // doesn't log
```

## Larger example

Here's a (partial) implementation of Redux's `createStore`:

```js
const createStore = (reducer, initialState) => {
  let state = initialState
  const emitter = createChangeEmitter()

  function dispatch(action) {
    state = reducer(state, action)
    emitter.emit()
    return action
  }

  function getState() {
    return state
  }

  return {
    dispatch,
    getState,
    subscribe: emitter.listen
  }
}
```

> A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / FSEvents.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)

## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on MacOS.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues)
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Chokidar resolves these problems.

Initially made for **[Brunch](http://brunch.io)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
[gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
[karma](http://karma-runner.github.io),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/),
[BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/),
[Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/).
It has proven itself in production environments.

## How?
Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.

On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
`FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still
does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.

On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed.

## Getting started
Install with npm:

```sh
npm install chokidar
```

Then `require` and use it in your code:

```javascript
var chokidar = require('chokidar');

// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles
chokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {
  console.log(event, path);
});
```

```javascript
// Example of a more typical implementation structure:

// Initialize watcher.
var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {
  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,
  persistent: true
});

// Something to use when events are received.
var log = console.log.bind(console);
// Add event listeners.
watcher
  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))
  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))
  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));

// More possible events.
watcher
  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))
  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))
  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))
  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))
  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {
    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);
  });

// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second
// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {
  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);
});

// Watch new files.
watcher.add('new-file');
watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);

// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem
var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();

// Un-watch some files.
watcher.unwatch('new-file*');

// Stop watching.
watcher.close();

// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)
chokidar.watch('file', {
  persistent: true,

  ignored: '*.txt',
  ignoreInitial: false,
  followSymlinks: true,
  cwd: '.',
  disableGlobbing: false,

  usePolling: true,
  interval: 100,
  binaryInterval: 300,
  alwaysStat: false,
  depth: 99,
  awaitWriteFinish: {
    stabilityThreshold: 2000,
    pollInterval: 100
  },

  ignorePermissionErrors: false,
  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)
});

```

## API

`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`

* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
recursively, or glob patterns.
* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:

#### Persistence

* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted
after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.

#### Path filtering

* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object of that path).
* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while
instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).
* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.
* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.
* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as
literal path names, even if they look like globs.

#### Performance

* `usePolling` (default: `false`).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is
typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over
a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the
`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.
* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)
  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also
    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.
  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
  polling for binary files.
  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the
`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly
and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When
set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.
* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set
this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
already available from the underlying watch events.
* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.
* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).
By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`
events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a
configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
Use with caution.
  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust
  timing params:*
  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in
  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.
  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.

#### Errors
* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files
that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`
or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.
* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
"atomic writes" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event
rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in
milliseconds.

### Methods & Events

`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:

* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,
`raw`, `error`.
Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.
* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.
* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the
directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the
values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.

## CLI

If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to
execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.

## Install Troubleshooting

* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`
  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is
    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
    Chokidar should function properly.

* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable "python" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`
  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:
    `npm config set python python2.7`

* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`
  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools

# Command-Option-Argument
[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/veged/coa.png)](http://travis-ci.org/veged/coa)

## What is it?

COA is a parser for command line options that aim to get maximum profit from formalization your program API.
Once you write definition in terms of commands, options and arguments you automaticaly get:

* Command line help text
* Program API for use COA-based programs as modules
* Shell completion

### Other features

* Rich types for options and arguments, such as arrays, boolean flags and required
* Commands can be async throught using promising (powered by [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q))
* Easy submoduling some existing commands to new top-level one
* Combined validation and complex parsing of values

### TODO

* Localization
* Shell-mode
* Configs
 * Aliases
 * Defaults

## Examples

````javascript
require('coa').Cmd() // main (top level) command declaration
    .name(process.argv[1]) // set top level command name from program name
    .title('My awesome command line util') // title for use in text messages
    .helpful() // make command "helpful", i.e. options -h --help with usage message
    .opt() // add some option
        .name('version') // name for use in API
        .title('Version') // title for use in text messages
        .short('v') // short key: -v
        .long('version') // long key: --version
        .flag() // for options without value
        .act(function(opts) { // add action for option
            // return message as result of action
            return JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(__dirname + '/package.json'))
                .version;
        })
        .end() // end option chain and return to main command
    .cmd().name('subcommand').apply(require('./subcommand').COA).end() // load subcommand from module
    .cmd() // inplace subcommand declaration
        .name('othercommand').title('Awesome other subcommand').helpful()
        .opt()
            .name('input').title('input file, required')
            .short('i').long('input')
            .val(function(v) { // validator function, also for translate simple values
                return require('fs').createReadStream(v) })
            .req() // make option required
            .end() // end option chain and return to command
        .end() // end subcommand chain and return to parent command
    .run(process.argv.slice(2)); // parse and run on process.argv
````

````javascript
// subcommand.js
exports.COA = function() {
    this
        .title('Awesome subcommand').helpful()
        .opt()
            .name('output').title('output file')
            .short('o').long('output')
            .output() // use default preset for "output" option declaration
            .end()
};

css-color-names
===============

A JSON Object of css color names mapped to their hex value

Usage
-----

``` js
var csscolors = require('css-color-names');
console.dir(csscolors);
```

yields

``` json
{
  "aqua": "#00ffff",
  "aliceblue": "#f0f8ff",
  "antiquewhite": "#faebd7",
  "black": "#000000",
  "blue": "#0000ff",
  ...
}
```

How was this list generated?
----------------------------

In the Makefile you'll see a line like this:

	./getcolors.sh | ./stringify.js > $(FILE)

The first command scrapes a site for the list,
and outputs the results separated by newlines.  The
second command creates the JSON object and outputs
it to stdout, which then gets redirected into
`css-color-names.json`

Installation
------------

    npm install css-color-names

I use algorithm kindly provided by TheSpanishInquisition here: <http://jsperf.com/damerau-levenshtein-distance>.

All credits goes there. I have only packed it into Node module.

It provides a function that takes two string arguments and returns a hash like this:

```` javascript
{
  steps: 5,       // Levenstein demerau distance
  relative: 0.7,  // steps / length of the longer string
  similarity: 0.3 // 1 - relative
}
````

  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
  as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
  meet the following conditions:

  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that You changed the files; and

  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
      the Derivative Works; and

  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.

  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
for your cryptography operations.

## Incentive

ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
even more slower.

## API

### ECDSA

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;

// Create and initialize EC context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC('secp256k1');

// Generate keys
var key = ec.genKeyPair();

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash);

// Export DER encoded signature in Array
var derSign = signature.toDER();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

var pubPoint = key.getPublic();
var x = pubPoint.getX();
var y = pubPoint.getY();

// Public Key MUST be either:
// 1) '04' + hex string of x + hex string of y; or
// 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or
// 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y)
var pub = pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1
var pub = { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2
var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3
var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3

// Import public key
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Signature MUST be either:
// 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or
// 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
// 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or
// 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)

var signature = '3046022100...'; // case 1
var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2
var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### EdDSA

```javascript
var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;

// Create and initialize EdDSA context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');

// Create key pair from secret
var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Import public key
var pub = '0a1af638...';
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Verify signature
var signature = '70bed1...';
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### ECDH

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

// Generate keys
var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();

var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());

console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances');
console.log(shared1.toString(16));
console.log(shared2.toString(16));
```

three and more members:
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

var A = ec.genKeyPair();
var B = ec.genKeyPair();
var C = ec.genKeyPair();

var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())

var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())

console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
```

NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.

## Supported curves

Elliptic.js support following curve types:

* Short Weierstrass
* Montgomery
* Edwards
* Twisted Edwards

Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:

* `secp256k1`
* `p192`
* `p224`
* `p256`
* `p384`
* `p521`
* `curve25519`
* `ed25519`

NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.

### Implementation details

ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.

All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
provided by [hash.js][2]

### Related projects

* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
  node)

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - enhanced-resolve@3.4.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# enhanced-resolve

Offers an async require.resolve function. It's highly configurable.

## Features

* plugin system
* provide a custom filesystem
* sync and async node.js filesystems included


## Getting Started
### Install
```sh
# npm
npm install enhanced-resolve
# or Yarn
yarn add enhanced-resolve
```

### Creating a Resolver
The easiest way to create a resolver is to use the `createResolver` function on `ResolveFactory`, along with one of the supplied File System implementations.
```js
const {
  NodeJsInputFileSystem,
  CachedInputFileSystem,
  ResolverFactory
} = require('enhanced-resolve');

// create a resolver
const myResolver = ResolverFactory.createResolver({
  // Typical usage will consume the `NodeJsInputFileSystem` + `CachedInputFileSystem`, which wraps the Node.js `fs` wrapper to add resilience + caching.
  fileSystem: new CachedInputFileSystem(new NodeJsInputFileSystem(), 4000),
  extensions: ['.js', '.json']
  /* any other resolver options here. Options/defaults can be seen below */
});

// resolve a file with the new resolver
const context = {};
const lookupStartPath = '/Users/webpack/some/root/dir';
const request = './path/to-look-up.js';
myResolver.resolve({}, lookupStartPath, request, (err/*Error*/, filepath/*string*/) => {
  // Do something with the path
});
```

For more examples creating different types resolvers (sync/async, context, etc) see `lib/node.js`.

| resolver                 | undefined                   | A prepared Resolver to which the plugins are attached |

## Plugins
Similar to `webpack`, the core of `enhanced-resolve` functionality is implemented as individual plugins that are executed using [`Tapable`](https://github.com/webpack/tapable). These plugins can extend the functionality of the library, adding other ways for files/contexts to be resolved.

A plugin should be a `class` (or its ES5 equivalent) with an `apply` method. The `apply` method will receive a `resolver` instance, that can be used to hook in to the event system.

### Plugin Boilerplate
```js
class MyResolverPlugin {
  constructor(source, target) {
    this.source = source;
    this.target = target;
  }

  apply(resolver) {
    resolver.plugin(this.source, (request, callback) => {
      // Any logic you need to create a new `request` can go here
      resolver.doResolve(this.target, request, null, callback);
    });
  }
}
```

Plugins are executed in a pipeline, and register which event they should be executed before/after. In the example above, `source` is the name of the event that starts the pipeline, and `target` is what event this plugin should fire, which is what continues the execution of the pipeline. For an example of how these different plugin events create a chain, see `lib/ResolverFactory.js`, in the `//// pipeline ////` section.

## Tests

``` javascript
npm test
```

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve)


## Passing options from webpack
If you are using `webpack`, and you want to pass custom options to `enhanced-resolve`, the options are passed from the `resolve` key of your webpack configuration e.g.:

```
resolve: {
  extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx'],
  modules: ['src', 'node_modules'],
  plugins: [new DirectoryNamedWebpackPlugin()]
  ...
},
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - errno@0.1.7

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# node-errno

> Better [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)/[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)/[io.js](https://iojs.org) error handling & reporting. Available in npm as *errno*.

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)

* [errno exposed](#errnoexposed)
* [Custom errors](#customerrors)

<a name="errnoexposed"></a>
## errno exposed

Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.

**By errno:**

```js
require('errno').errno[3]
// → {
//     "errno": 3,
//     "code": "EACCES",
//     "description": "permission denied"
//   }
```

**By code:**

```js
require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY
// → {
//     "errno": 53,
//     "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
//     "description": "directory not empty"
//   }
```

**Make your errors more descriptive:**

```js
var errno = require('errno')

function errmsg(err) {
  var str = 'Error: '
  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno
  if (errno.errno[err.errno])
    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
  else
    str += err.message

  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property
  if (err.path)
    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'

  return str
}

var fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(errmsg(err))
})
```

**Use as a command line tool:**

```
~ $ errno 53
{
  "errno": 53,
  "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
  "description": "directory not empty"
}
~ $ errno EROFS
{
  "errno": 56,
  "code": "EROFS",
  "description": "read-only file system"
}
~ $ errno foo
No such errno/code: "foo"
```

Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.

You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.

<a name="customerrors"></a>
## Custom errors

Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.

```js
var create = require('errno').custom.createError
var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error
var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError
var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)

// use them!
if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')

if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
```

Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:

```js
fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {
  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
  // do something else
})
```

The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - eslint-config-react-app@2.1.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# eslint-config-react-app

This package includes the shareable ESLint configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).<br>
Please refer to its documentation:

* [Getting Started](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) – How to create a new app.
* [User Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Usage in Create React App Projects

The easiest way to use this configuration is with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which includes it by default.

**You don’t need to install it separately in Create React App projects.**

## Usage Outside of Create React App

If you want to use this ESLint configuration in a project not built with Create React App, you can install it with following steps.

First, install this package, ESLint and the necessary plugins.

  ```sh
  npm install --save-dev eslint-config-react-app babel-eslint@^7.2.3 eslint@^4.1.1 eslint-plugin-flowtype@^2.34.1 eslint-plugin-import@^2.6.0 eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@^5.1.1 eslint-plugin-react@^7.1.0
  ```

Then create a file named `.eslintrc` with following contents in the root folder of your project:

  ```js
  {
    "extends": "react-app"
  }
  ```

  That's it! You can override the settings from `eslint-config-react-app` by editing the `.eslintrc` file. Learn more about [configuring ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) on the ESLint website.

## Accessibility Checks

The following rules from the [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) plugin are activated:

- [accessible-emoji](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/accessible-emoji.md)

- [scope](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/scope.md)

If you want to enable even more accessibility rules, you can create an `.eslintrc` file in the root of your project with this content:

  ```json
  {
    "extends": ["react-app", "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended"],
    "plugins": ["jsx-a11y"]
  }
  ```

However, if you are using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and have not ejected, any additional rules will only be displayed in the [IDE integrations](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#displaying-lint-output-in-the-editor), but not in the browser or the terminal.

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/eslint-import-resolver-node.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-node)

Default Node-style module resolution plugin for [`eslint-plugin-import`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import).

Published separately to allow pegging to a specific version in case of breaking
changes.

Config is passed directly through to [`resolve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve#resolve-sync-id-opts) as options:

```yaml
settings:
  import/resolver:
    node:
      extensions:
        # if unset, default is just '.js', but it must be re-added explicitly if set
        - .js
        - .jsx
        - .es6
        - .coffee

      paths:
        # an array of absolute paths which will also be searched
        # think NODE_PATH
        - /usr/local/share/global_modules

      # this is technically for identifying `node_modules` alternate names
      moduleDirectory:

        - node_modules # defaults to 'node_modules', but...
        - bower_components

        - project/src  # can add a path segment here that will act like
                       # a source root, for in-project aliasing (i.e.
                       # `import MyStore from 'stores/my-store'`)
```

or to use the default options:

```yaml
settings:
  import/resolver: node
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - esrecurse@4.2.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)

Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is
[ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
recursive traversing functionality.

### Example Usage

The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(ast, {
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});
```

We can use `Visitor` instance.

```javascript
var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});

visitor.visit(ast);
```

We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.

```javascript
class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {
    constructor()
    {
        super(null);
    }

    XXXStatement(node) {
    }
}
```

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    this.visit(node.left);
    // do something...
    this.visit(node.right);
};
```

And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    // do something...
    this.visitChildren(node);
};
```

The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`.
We can use user-defined node types.

```javascript
// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
var tree = {
    type: 'TestExpression',

    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.
    argument: {
        type: 'Literal',
        value: 20
    },

    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.
    extended: true
};
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        // Extending the existing traversing rules.
        childVisitorKeys: {
            // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]
            TestExpression: ['argument']
        }
    }
);
```

We can use the `fallback` option as well.
If the `fallback` option is `"iteration"`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: 'iteration'
    }
);
```

If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: function (node) {
            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {
                return key !== 'argument'
            });
        }
    }
);
```

# faye-websocket

* Travis CI build: [![Build
  status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node)
* Autobahn tests: [server](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/servers/),
  [client](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/clients/)

This is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the
[Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project. It provides classes for easily building
WebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but
rather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction
other than the standard [WebSocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/).

It also provides an abstraction for handling
[EventSource](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) connections, which are
one-way connections that allow the server to push data to the client. They are
based on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access via proxies than
WebSockets.


## Installation

```
$ npm install faye-websocket
```


## Handling WebSocket connections in Node

You can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade
requests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes
the usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this
is how you'd implement an echo server:

```js
var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),
    http      = require('http');

var server = http.createServer();

server.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {
  if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {
    var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);
    
    ws.on('message', function(event) {
      ws.send(event.data);
    });
    
    ws.on('close', function(event) {
      console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);
      ws = null;
    });
  }
});

server.listen(8000);
```

`WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the
`ws.on('message', ...)` line with:

```js
    ws.pipe(ws);
```

Note that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting
through an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you
call `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire
handshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer
the message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any
buffered messages will be sent to the client.

If you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the
`onopen` event.

If the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to
send a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a
message string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message
is received. It returns `true` if and only if a ping message was sent. If the
client does not support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns
`false`.

```js
ws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {
  // fires when pong is received
});
```


## Using the WebSocket client

The client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss`
protocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web
browser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.

```js
var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),
    ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');

ws.on('open', function(event) {
  console.log('open');
  ws.send('Hello, world!');
});

ws.on('message', function(event) {
  console.log('message', event.data);
});

ws.on('close', function(event) {
  console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);
  ws = null;
});
```

The WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the
handshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.

To connect via a proxy, set the `proxy` option to the HTTP origin of the proxy,
including any authorization information, custom headers and TLS config you
require. Only the `origin` setting is required.

```js
var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', [], {
  proxy: {
    origin:  'http://username:password@proxy.example.com',
    headers: {'User-Agent': 'node'},
    tls:     {cert: fs.readFileSync('client.crt')}
  }
});
```

The `tls` value is a Node 'TLS options' object that will be passed to
[`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).


## Subprotocol negotiation

The WebSocket protocol allows peers to select and identify the application
protocol to use over the connection. On the client side, you can set which
protocols the client accepts by passing a list of protocol names when you
construct the socket:

```js
var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', ['irc', 'amqp']);
```

On the server side, you can likewise pass in the list of protocols the server
supports after the other constructor arguments:

```js
var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, ['irc', 'amqp']);
```

If the client and server agree on a protocol, both the client- and server-side
socket objects expose the selected protocol through the `ws.protocol` property.


## Protocol extensions

faye-websocket is based on the
[websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)
framework that allows extensions to be negotiated via the
`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. To add extensions to a connection, pass an
array of extensions to the `:extensions` option. For example, to add
[permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node):

```js
var deflate = require('permessage-deflate');

var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, [], {extensions: [deflate]});
```


## Initialization options

Both the server- and client-side classes allow an options object to be passed in
at initialization time, for example:

```js
var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, protocols, options);
var ws = new WebSocket.Client(url, protocols, options);
```

`protocols` is an array of subprotocols as described above, or `null`.
`options` is an optional object containing any of these fields:

* `extensions` - an array of
  [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)
  compatible extensions, as described above
* `headers` - an object containing key-value pairs representing HTTP headers to
  be sent during the handshake process
* `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.
  The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB.
* `ping` - an integer that sets how often the WebSocket should send ping frames,
  measured in seconds

The client accepts some additional options:

* `proxy` - settings for a proxy as described above
* `tls` - a Node 'TLS options' object containing TLS settings for the origin
  server, this will be passed to
  [`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback)
* `ca` - (legacy) a shorthand for passing `{tls: {ca: value}}`


## WebSocket API

Both server- and client-side `WebSocket` objects support the following API.

* <b>`on('open', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket connection is
  established. Event has no attributes.
* <b>`on('message', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket receives a
  message. Event has one attribute, <b>`data`</b>, which is either a `String`
  (for text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames).
* <b>`on('error', function(event) {})`</b> fires when there is a protocol error
  due to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational,
  you do not need to implement error recover.
* <b>`on('close', function(event) {})`</b> fires when either the client or the
  server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes, <b>`code`</b>
  and <b>`reason`</b>, that expose the status code and message sent by the peer
  that closed the connection.
* <b>`send(message)`</b> accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a
  text or binary message over the connection to the other peer.
* <b>`ping(message, function() {})`</b> sends a ping frame with an optional
  message and fires the callback when a matching pong is received.
* <b>`close(code, reason)`</b> closes the connection, sending the given status
  code and reason text, both of which are optional.
* <b>`version`</b> is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket`
  protocol the connection is using.
* <b>`protocol`</b> is a string (which may be empty) identifying the subprotocol
  the socket is using.


## Handling EventSource connections in Node

EventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they
only allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API.
EventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each
message has an optional event-type and ID.

```js
var WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),
    EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,
    http        = require('http');

var server = http.createServer();

server.on('request', function(request, response) {
  if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {
    var es = new EventSource(request, response);
    console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);
    
    // Periodically send messages
    var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);
    
    es.on('close', function() {
      clearInterval(loop);
      es = null;
    });
  
  } else {
    // Normal HTTP request
    response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    response.end('Hello');
  }
});

server.listen(8000);
```

The `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default
event-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification`
event with ID `99`:

```js
es.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'});
```

The `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:

* <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the
  EventSource.
* <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the
  client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection
  to determine which messages need resending.

When you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass
configuration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:

* <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the
  EventSource response.
* <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it
  should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect.
* <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send
  'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts
  set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.

For example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings
every 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:

```js
var es = new EventSource(request, response, {
  headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},
  ping:    15,
  retry:   10
});
```

You can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike
WebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send
some data over the wire to keep the connection alive.

```js
var WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),
    EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,
    http        = require('http');

var server = http.createServer();

server.on('request', function(request, response) {
  if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {
    var es = new EventSource(request, response);
    console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);
    
    // Periodically send messages
    var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);
    
    es.on('close', function() {
      clearInterval(loop);
      es = null;
    });
  
  } else {
    // Normal HTTP request
    response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    response.end('Hello');
  }
});

server.listen(8000);
```

The `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default
event-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification`
event with ID `99`:

```js
es.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'});
```

The `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:

* <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the
  EventSource.
* <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the
  client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection
  to determine which messages need resending.

When you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass
configuration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:

* <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the
  EventSource response.
* <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it
  should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect.
* <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send
  'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts
  set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.

For example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings
every 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:

```js
var es = new EventSource(request, response, {
  headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},
  ping:    15,
  retry:   10
});
```

You can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike
WebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send
some data over the wire to keep the connection alive.

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/css-modules/icss-replace-symbols/master.svg?style=flat-square)]()

# ICSS — Replace Symbols

Governs the way tokens are searched & replaced during the linking stage of ICSS loading.

This is broken into its own module in case the behaviour needs to be replicated in other PostCSS plugins (i.e. [CSS Modules Constants](https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules-constants))

## API

```js
import replaceSymbols from "icss-replace-symbols"
replaceSymbols(css, translations)
```

Where:

- `css` is the PostCSS tree you're working with
- `translations` is an JS object of `symbol: "replacement"` pairs, where all occurrences of `symbol` are replaced with `replacement`.

## Behaviour

A symbol is a string of alphanumeric, `-` or `_` characters. A replacement can be any string. They are replaced in the following places:

- In the value of a declaration, i.e. `color: my_symbol;` or `box-shadow: 0 0 blur spread shadow-color`
- In a media expression i.e. `@media small {}` or `@media screen and not-large {}`

# ignore

`ignore` is a manager, filter and parser which implemented in pure JavaScript according to the .gitignore [spec](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

Pay attention that [`minimatch`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/minimatch) does not work in the gitignore way. To filter filenames according to .gitignore file, I recommend this module.

##### Tested on

- Linux + Node: `0.8` - `7.x`
- Windows + Node: `0.10` - `7.x`, node < `0.10` is not tested due to the lack of support of appveyor.

Actually, `ignore` does not rely on any versions of node specially.

## Table Of Main Contents

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Guide for 2.x -> 3.x](#upgrade-2x---3x)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- Related Packages
  - [`glob-gitignore`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-gitignore) matches files using patterns and filters them according to gitignore rules.

## Usage

```js
const ignore = require('ignore')
const ig = ignore().add(['.abc/*', '!.abc/d/'])
```

### Filter the given paths

```js
const paths = [
  '.abc/a.js',    // filtered out
  '.abc/d/e.js'   // included
]

ig.filter(paths)        // ['.abc/d/e.js']
ig.ignores('.abc/a.js') // true
```

### As the filter function

```js
paths.filter(ig.createFilter()); // ['.abc/d/e.js']
```

### Win32 paths will be handled

```js
ig.filter(['.abc\\a.js', '.abc\\d\\e.js'])
// if the code above runs on windows, the result will be
// ['.abc\\d\\e.js']
```

## Why another ignore?

- `ignore` is a standalone module, and is much simpler so that it could easy work with other programs, unlike [isaacs](https://npmjs.org/~isaacs)'s [fstream-ignore](https://npmjs.org/package/fstream-ignore) which must work with the modules of the fstream family.

- `ignore` only contains utility methods to filter paths according to the specified ignore rules, so
  - `ignore` never try to find out ignore rules by traversing directories or fetching from git configurations.
  - `ignore` don't cares about sub-modules of git projects.

- Exactly according to [gitignore man page](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), fixes some known matching issues of fstream-ignore, such as:
  - '`/*.js`' should only match '`a.js`', but not '`abc/a.js`'.
  - '`**/foo`' should match '`foo`' anywhere.
  - Prevent re-including a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.
  - Handle trailing whitespaces:
    - `'a '`(one space) should not match `'a  '`(two spaces).
    - `'a \ '` matches `'a  '`
  - All test cases are verified with the result of `git check-ignore`.

## Methods

### .add(pattern)
### .add(patterns)

- **pattern** `String|Ignore` An ignore pattern string, or the `Ignore` instance
- **patterns** `Array.<pattern>` Array of ignore patterns.

Adds a rule or several rules to the current manager.

Returns `this`

Notice that a line starting with `'#'`(hash) is treated as a comment. Put a backslash (`'\'`) in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash, if you want to ignore a file with a hash at the beginning of the filename.

```js
ignore().add('#abc').ignores('#abc')    // false
ignore().add('\#abc').ignores('#abc')   // true
```

`pattern` could either be a line of ignore pattern or a string of multiple ignore patterns, which means we could just `ignore().add()` the content of a ignore file:

```js
ignore()
.add(fs.readFileSync(filenameOfGitignore).toString())
.filter(filenames)
```

`pattern` could also be an `ignore` instance, so that we could easily inherit the rules of another `Ignore` instance.

### <strike>.addIgnoreFile(path)</strike>

REMOVED in `3.x` for now.

To upgrade `ignore@2.x` up to `3.x`, use

```js
const fs = require('fs')

if (fs.existsSync(filename)) {
  ignore().add(fs.readFileSync(filename).toString())
}
```

instead.


### .ignores(pathname)

> new in 3.2.0

Returns `Boolean` whether `pathname` should be ignored.

```js
ig.ignores('.abc/a.js')    // true
```

### .filter(paths)

Filters the given array of pathnames, and returns the filtered array.

- **paths** `Array.<path>` The array of `pathname`s to be filtered.

**NOTICE** that:

- `pathname` should be a string that have been `path.join()`ed, or the return value of `path.relative()` to the current directory.

```js
// WRONG
ig.ignores('./abc')

// WRONG, for it will never happen.
// If the gitignore rule locates at the root directory,
// `'/abc'` should be changed to `'abc'`.
// ```
// path.relative('/', '/abc')  -> 'abc'
// ```
ig.ignores('/abc')

// Right
ig.ignores('abc')

// Right
ig.ignores(path.join('./abc'))  // path.join('./abc') -> 'abc'
```

- In other words, each `pathname` here should be a relative path to the directory of the git ignore rules.

Suppose the dir structure is:

```
/path/to/your/repo
    |-- a
    |   |-- a.js
    |
    |-- .b
    |
    |-- .c
         |-- .DS_store
```

Then the `paths` might be like this:

```js
[
  'a/a.js'
  '.b',
  '.c/.DS_store'
]
```

Usually, you could use [`glob`](http://npmjs.org/package/glob) with `option.mark = true` to fetch the structure of the current directory:

```js
const glob = require('glob')

glob('**', {
  // Adds a / character to directory matches.
  mark: true
}, (err, files) => {
  if (err) {
    return console.error(err)
  }

  let filtered = ignore().add(patterns).filter(files)
  console.log(filtered)
})
```

### .createFilter()

Creates a filter function which could filter an array of paths with `Array.prototype.filter`.

Returns `function(path)` the filter function.

****

## Upgrade 2.x -> 3.x

- All `options` of 2.x are unnecessary and removed, so just remove them.
- `ignore()` instance is no longer an [`EventEmitter`](nodejs.org/api/events.html), and all events are unnecessary and removed.
- `.addIgnoreFile()` is removed, see the [.addIgnoreFile](#addignorefilepath) section for details.

****

## Contributing

The code of `node-ignore` is based on es6 and babel, but babel and its preset is not included in the `dependencies` field of package.json, so that the installation process of test cases will not fail in older versions of node.

So use `bash install.sh` to install dependencies and `bash test.sh` to run test cases in your local machine.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - imurmurhash@0.1.4

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

## Goal and Philosophy

<img align="right" alt="Inquirer Logo" src="/assets/inquirer_readme.png" title="Inquirer.js"/>

**`Inquirer.js`** strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (and perhaps the "CLI [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane)").

**`Inquirer.js`** should ease the process of
- providing *error feedback*
- *asking questions*
- *parsing* input
- *validating* answers
- managing *hierarchical prompts*

> **Note:** **`Inquirer.js`** provides the user interface and the inquiry session flow. If you're searching for a full blown command line program utility, then check out [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js), [vorpal](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal) or [args](https://github.com/leo/args).


## [Documentation](#documentation)
<a name="documentation"></a>

### Installation
<a name="installation"></a>

``` shell
npm install inquirer
```

```javascript
var inquirer = require('inquirer');
inquirer.prompt([/* Pass your questions in here */]).then(function (answers) {
	// Use user feedback for... whatever!!
});
```

<a name="examples"></a>
### Examples (Run it and see it)
Check out the `examples/` folder for code and interface examples.

``` shell
node examples/pizza.js
node examples/checkbox.js
# etc...
```


### Methods
<a name="methods"></a>
#### `inquirer.prompt(questions) -> promise`

Launch the prompt interface (inquiry session)

- **questions** (Array) containing [Question Object](#question) (using the [reactive interface](#reactive-interface), you can also pass a `Rx.Observable` instance)
- returns a **Promise**

#### `inquirer.registerPrompt(name, prompt)`

Register prompt plugins under `name`.

- **name** (string) name of the this new prompt. (used for question `type`)
- **prompt** (object) the prompt object itself (the plugin)

#### `inquirer.createPromptModule() -> prompt function`

Create a self contained inquirer module. If you don't want to affect other libraries that also rely on inquirer when you overwrite or add new prompt types.

```js
var prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule();

prompt(questions).then(/* ... */);
```

### Objects
<a name="objects"></a>

#### Question
<a name="questions"></a>
A question object is a `hash` containing question related values:

- **type**: (String) Type of the prompt. Defaults: `input` - Possible values: `input`, `confirm`,
`list`, `rawlist`, `expand`, `checkbox`, `password`, `editor`
- **name**: (String) The name to use when storing the answer in the answers hash. If the name contains periods, it will define a path in the answers hash.
- **message**: (String|Function) The question to print. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **default**: (String|Number|Array|Function) Default value(s) to use if nothing is entered, or a function that returns the default value(s). If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **choices**: (Array|Function) Choices array or a function returning a choices array. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
Array values can be simple `strings`, or `objects` containing a `name` (to display in list), a `value` (to save in the answers hash) and a `short` (to display after selection) properties. The choices array can also contain [a `Separator`](#separator).
- **validate**: (Function) Receive the user input and answers hash. Should return `true` if the value is valid, and an error message (`String`) otherwise. If `false` is returned, a default error message is provided.
- **filter**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the filtered value to be used inside the program. The value returned will be added to the _Answers_ hash.
- **when**: (Function, Boolean) Receive the current user answers hash and should return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not this question should be asked. The value can also be a simple boolean.
- **pageSize**: (Number) Change the number of lines that will be rendered when using `list`, `rawList`, `expand` or `checkbox`.
- **prefix**: (String) Change the default _prefix_ message.
- **suffix**: (String) Change the default _suffix_ message.

`default`, `choices`(if defined as functions), `validate`, `filter` and `when` functions can be called asynchronous. Either return a promise or use `this.async()` to get a callback you'll call with the final value.

``` javascript
{
  /* Preferred way: with promise */
  filter: function () {
    return new Promise(/* etc... */);
  },

  /* Legacy way: with this.async */
  validate: function (input) {
    // Declare function as asynchronous, and save the done callback
    var done = this.async();

    // Do async stuff
    setTimeout(function () {
      if (typeof input !== 'number') {
        // Pass the return value in the done callback
        done('You need to provide a number');
        return;
      }
      // Pass the return value in the done callback
      done(null, true);
    }, 3000);
  }
}
```

### Answers
<a name="answers"></a>
A key/value hash containing the client answers in each prompt.

- **Key** The `name` property of the _question_ object
- **Value** (Depends on the prompt)
  - `confirm`: (Boolean)
  - `input` : User input (filtered if `filter` is defined) (String)
  - `rawlist`, `list` : Selected choice value (or name if no value specified) (String)

### Separator
<a name="separator"></a>
A separator can be added to any `choices` array:

```
// In the question object
choices: [ "Choice A", new inquirer.Separator(), "choice B" ]

// Which'll be displayed this way
[?] What do you want to do?
 > Order a pizza
   Make a reservation
   --------
   Ask opening hours
   Talk to the receptionist
```

The constructor takes a facultative `String` value that'll be use as the separator. If omitted, the separator will be `--------`.

Separator instances have a property `type` equal to `separator`. This should allow tools façading Inquirer interface from detecting separator types in lists.

<a name="prompt"></a>
### Prompt types
---------------------

> **Note:**: _allowed options written inside square brackets (`[]`) are optional. Others are required._

#### List - `{type: 'list'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array or a choice `value`)

![List prompt](assets/screenshots/list-prompt.png)

---

#### Raw List - `{type: 'rawlist'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must the choice `index` in the array)

![Raw list prompt](assets/screenshots/rawlist-prompt.png)

---

#### Expand - `{type: 'expand'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array. If `default` key not provided, then `help` will be used as default choice)

Note that the `choices` object will take an extra parameter called `key` for the `expand` prompt. This parameter must be a single (lowercased) character. The `h` option is added by the prompt and shouldn't be defined by the user.

See `examples/expand.js` for a running example.

![Expand prompt closed](assets/screenshots/expand-prompt-1.png)
![Expand prompt expanded](assets/screenshots/expand-prompt-2.png)

---

#### Checkbox - `{type: 'checkbox'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `filter`, `validate`, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be an Array of the checked choices value.

Choices marked as `{checked: true}` will be checked by default.

Choices whose property `disabled` is truthy will be unselectable. If `disabled` is a string, then the string will be outputted next to the disabled choice, otherwise it'll default to `"Disabled"`. The `disabled` property can also be a synchronous function receiving the current answers as argument and returning a boolean or a string.

![Checkbox prompt](assets/screenshots/checkbox-prompt.png)

---

#### Confirm - `{type: 'confirm'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be a boolean if used.

![Confirm prompt](assets/screenshots/confirm-prompt.png)

---

#### Input - `{type: 'input'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.

![Input prompt](assets/screenshots/input-prompt.png)

---

#### Password - `{type: 'password'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.

![Password prompt](assets/screenshots/password-prompt.png)

---

#### Editor - `{type: 'editor'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties

Launches an instance of the users preferred editor on a temporary file. Once the user exits their editor, the contents of the temporary file are read in as the result. The editor to use is determined by reading the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables. If neither of those are present, notepad (on Windows) or vim (Linux or Mac) is used.

<a name="layouts"></a>
## User Interfaces and layouts


Along with the prompts, Inquirer offers some basic text UI.

#### Bottom Bar - `inquirer.ui.BottomBar`

This UI present a fixed text at the bottom of a free text zone. This is useful to keep a message to the bottom of the screen while outputting command outputs on the higher section.

```javascript
var ui = new inquirer.ui.BottomBar();

// pipe a Stream to the log zone
outputStream.pipe(ui.log);

// Or simply write output
ui.log.write('something just happened.');
ui.log.write('Almost over, standby!');

// During processing, update the bottom bar content to display a loader
// or output a progress bar, etc
ui.updateBottomBar('new bottom bar content');
```

<a name="reactive"></a>
## Reactive interface


Internally, Inquirer uses the [JS reactive extension](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) to handle events and async flows.

This mean you can take advantage of this feature to provide more advanced flows. For example, you can dynamically add questions to be asked:

```js
var prompts = new Rx.Subject();
inquirer.prompt(prompts);

// At some point in the future, push new questions
prompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });
prompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });

// When you're done
prompts.onCompleted();
```

And using the return value `process` property, you can access more fine grained callbacks:

```js
inquirer.prompt(prompts).ui.process.subscribe(
  onEachAnswer,
  onError,
  onComplete
);
```

## Support (OS Terminals)
<a name="support"></a>

You should expect mostly good support for the CLI below. This does not mean we won't
look at issues found on other command line - feel free to report any!

- **Mac OS**:
  - Terminal.app

jsonify
=======

This module provides Douglas Crockford's JSON implementation without modifying
any globals.

global `JSON` object exists.

methods
=======

var json = require('jsonify');

json.parse(source, reviver)
---------------------------

Return a new javascript object from a parse of the `source` string.

If a `reviver` function is specified, walk the structure passing each name/value
pair to `reviver.call(parent, key, value)` to transform the `value` before
parsing it.

json.stringify(value, replacer, space)
--------------------------------------

Return a string representation for `value`.

If `replacer` is specified, walk the structure passing each name/value pair to
`replacer.call(parent, key, value)` to transform the `value` before stringifying
it.

If `space` is a number, indent the result by that many spaces.
If `space` is a string, use `space` as the indentation.

Natural Compare &ndash; [![Build][]][1] [![Coverage][]][2]
===============

Compare strings containing a mix of letters and numbers
in the way a human being would in sort order.
This is described as a "natural ordering".

```text
Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:
    img1.png            img1.png
    img10.png           img2.png
    img12.png           img10.png
    img2.png            img12.png
```

String.naturalCompare returns a number indicating
whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same
as the given string in sort order.
Use it with builtin sort() function.



### Installation

- In browser

```html
<script src=min.natural-compare.js></script>
```

- In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`

```javascript
require("natural-compare-lite")
```

### Usage

```javascript
// Simple case sensitive example
var a = ["z1.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z2.doc", "z23.doc", "z3.doc"];
a.sort(String.naturalCompare);
// ["z1.doc", "z2.doc", "z3.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z23.doc"]

// Use wrapper function for case insensitivity
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase());
})

// In most cases we want to sort an array of objects
var a = [ {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-1021"}
        , {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-21046-b"} ];

// sort by street, then by room
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room);
})

// When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()),
// it is best for performance to keep
// transformed key in that object.
// There are no need to do text transformation
// on each comparision when sorting.
var a = [ {"make":"Audi", "model":"A6"}
        , {"make":"Kia",  "model":"Rio"} ];

// sort by make, then by model
a.map(function(car){
  car.sort_key = (car.make + " " + car.model).toLowerCase();
})
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key);
})
```

- Works well with dates in ISO format eg "Rev 2012-07-26.doc".


### Custom alphabet

It is possible to configure a custom alphabet
to achieve a desired order.

```javascript
// Estonian alphabet
String.alphabet = "ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSŠZŽTUVÕÄÖÜXYabdefghijklmnoprsšzžtuvõäöüxy"
["t", "z", "x", "õ"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// ["z", "t", "õ", "x"]

// Russian alphabet
String.alphabet = "АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя"
["Ё", "А", "Б"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// ["А", "Б", "Ё"]
```

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the
GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
Forge project.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.

If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

# CSS Modules: Scope Locals & Extend

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope)

Transforms:

```css
:local(.continueButton) {
  color: green;
}
```

into:

```css
:export {
  continueButton: __buttons_continueButton_djd347adcxz9;
}
.__buttons_continueButton_djd347adcxz9 {
  color: green;
}
```

so it doesn't pollute CSS global scope and can be simply used in JS like so:

```js
import styles from './buttons.css'
elem.innerHTML = `<button class="${styles.continueButton}">Continue</button>`
```

## Composition

Since we're exporting class names, there's no reason to export only one. This can give us some really useful reuse of styles:

```css
.globalButtonStyle {
  background: white;
  border: 1px solid;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
}
.globalButtonStyle:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 0 4px -2px;
}
:local(.continueButton) {
  compose-with: globalButtonStyle;
  color: green;
}
```

becomes:

```
.globalButtonStyle {
  background: white;
  border: 1px solid;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
}
.globalButtonStyle:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 0 4px -2px;
}
:local(.continueButton) {
  compose-with: globalButtonStyle;
  color: green;
}
```

**Note:** you can also use `composes` as a shorthand for `compose-with`

## Local-by-default & reuse across files

You're looking for [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). It uses this plugin as well as a few others, and it's amazing.

## Building

```
npm install
npm test
```

@value small as bp-small, large as bp-large from "./breakpoints.css";

.header {
  composes: text-primary from colors;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px secondary;
}

@media bp-small {
  .header {
    box-shadow: 0 0 4px secondary;
  }
}
@media bp-large {
  .header {
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px secondary;
  }
}
```

**If you are using Sass** along with this PostCSS plugin, do not use the colon `:` in your `@value` definitions. It will cause Sass to crash.

Note also you can _import_ multiple values at once but can only _define_ one value per line.

```css
@value a: b, c: d; /* defines a as "b, c: d" */
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - react-dev-utils@4.2.3

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# react-dev-utils

This package includes some utilities used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).<br>
Please refer to its documentation:

* [Getting Started](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) – How to create a new app.
* [User Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Usage in Create React App Projects

These utilities come by default with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which includes it by default. **You don’t need to install it separately in Create React App projects.**

## Usage Outside of Create React App

If you don’t use Create React App, or if you [ejected](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject), you may keep using these utilities. Their development will be aligned with Create React App, so major versions of these utilities may come out relatively often. Feel free to fork or copy and paste them into your projects if you’d like to have more control over them, or feel free to use the old versions. Not all of them are React-specific, but we might make some of them more React-specific in the future.

### Entry Points

There is no single entry point. You can only import individual top-level modules.

#### `new InterpolateHtmlPlugin(replacements: {[key:string]: string})`

This Webpack plugin lets us interpolate custom variables into `index.html`.<br>
It works in tandem with [HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) 2.x via its [events](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin#events).

```js
var path = require('path');
var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-dev-plugin');
var InterpolateHtmlPlugin = require('react-dev-utils/InterpolateHtmlPlugin');

// Webpack config
var publicUrl = '/my-custom-url';

module.exports = {
  output: {
    // ...
    publicPath: publicUrl + '/'
  },
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // Makes the public URL available as %PUBLIC_URL% in index.html, e.g.:
    // <link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">
    new InterpolateHtmlPlugin({
      PUBLIC_URL: publicUrl
      // You can pass any key-value pairs, this was just an example.
      // WHATEVER: 42 will replace %WHATEVER% with 42 in index.html.
    }),
    // Generates an `index.html` file with the <script> injected.
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      inject: true,
      template: path.resolve('public/index.html'),
    }),
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
}
```


#### `new ModuleScopePlugin(appSrc: string, allowedFiles?: string[])`

This Webpack plugin ensures that relative imports from app's source directory don't reach outside of it.

```js
var path = require('path');
var ModuleScopePlugin = require('react-dev-utils/ModuleScopePlugin');


module.exports = {
  // ...
  resolve: {
    // ...
    plugins: [
      new ModuleScopePlugin(paths.appSrc, [paths.appPackageJson]),
      // ...
    ],
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

#### `new WatchMissingNodeModulesPlugin(nodeModulesPath: string)`

This Webpack plugin ensures `npm install <library>` forces a project rebuild.<br>
We’re not sure why this isn't Webpack's default behavior.<br>
See [#186](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/186) for details.

```js
var path = require('path');
var WatchMissingNodeModulesPlugin = require('react-dev-utils/WatchMissingNodeModulesPlugin');

// Webpack config
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ...
    // If you require a missing module and then `npm install` it, you still have
    // to restart the development server for Webpack to discover it. This plugin
    // makes the discovery automatic so you don't have to restart.
    // See https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/186
    new WatchMissingNodeModulesPlugin(path.resolve('node_modules'))
  ],
  // ...
}
```

#### `checkRequiredFiles(files: Array<string>): boolean`

Makes sure that all passed files exist.<br>
Filenames are expected to be absolute.<br>
If a file is not found, prints a warning message and returns `false`.

```js
var path = require('path');
var checkRequiredFiles = require('react-dev-utils/checkRequiredFiles');

if (!checkRequiredFiles([
  path.resolve('public/index.html'),
  path.resolve('src/index.js')
])) {
  process.exit(1);
}
```

#### `clearConsole(): void`

Clears the console, hopefully in a cross-platform way.

```js
var clearConsole = require('react-dev-utils/clearConsole');

clearConsole();
console.log('Just cleared the screen!');
```

#### `eslintFormatter(results: Object): string`

This is our custom ESLint formatter that integrates well with Create React App console output.<br>
You can use the default one instead if you prefer so.

```js
const eslintFormatter = require('react-dev-utils/eslintFormatter');

// In your webpack config:
// ...
module: {
   rules: [
     {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        include: paths.appSrc,
        enforce: 'pre',
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'eslint-loader',
            options: {
              // Pass the formatter:
              formatter: eslintFormatter,
            },
          },
        ],
      }
   ]
}
```

#### `FileSizeReporter`

##### `measureFileSizesBeforeBuild(buildFolder: string): Promise<OpaqueFileSizes>`

Captures JS and CSS asset sizes inside the passed `buildFolder`. Save the result value to compare it after the build.

##### `printFileSizesAfterBuild(webpackStats: WebpackStats, previousFileSizes: OpaqueFileSizes, buildFolder: string, maxBundleGzipSize?: number, maxChunkGzipSize?: number)`

Prints the JS and CSS asset sizes after the build, and includes a size comparison with `previousFileSizes` that were captured earlier using `measureFileSizesBeforeBuild()`. `maxBundleGzipSize` and `maxChunkGzipSizemay` may optionally be specified to display a warning when the main bundle or a chunk exceeds the specified size (in bytes).

```js
var {
  measureFileSizesBeforeBuild,
  printFileSizesAfterBuild,
} = require('react-dev-utils/FileSizeReporter');

measureFileSizesBeforeBuild(buildFolder).then(previousFileSizes => {
  return cleanAndRebuild().then(webpackStats => {
    printFileSizesAfterBuild(webpackStats, previousFileSizes, buildFolder);
  });
});
```

#### `formatWebpackMessages({errors: Array<string>, warnings: Array<string>}): {errors: Array<string>, warnings: Array<string>}`

Extracts and prettifies warning and error messages from webpack [stats](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/node.js-api#stats) object.

```js
var webpack = require('webpack');
var config = require('../config/webpack.config.dev');
var formatWebpackMessages = require('react-dev-utils/formatWebpackMessages');

var compiler = webpack(config);

compiler.plugin('invalid', function() {
  console.log('Compiling...');
});

compiler.plugin('done', function(stats) {
  var rawMessages = stats.toJson({}, true);
  var messages = formatWebpackMessages(rawMessages);
  if (!messages.errors.length && !messages.warnings.length) {
    console.log('Compiled successfully!');
  }
  if (messages.errors.length) {
    console.log('Failed to compile.');
    messages.errors.forEach(e => console.log(e));
    return;
  }
  if (messages.warnings.length) {
    console.log('Compiled with warnings.');
    messages.warnings.forEach(w => console.log(w));
  }
});
```

#### `printBuildError(error: Object): void`

Prettify some known build errors.
Pass an Error object to log a prettified error message in the console.

```
  const printBuildError = require('react-dev-utils/printBuildError')
  try {
    build()
  } catch(e) {
    printBuildError(e) // logs prettified message
  }
```

#### `getProcessForPort(port: number): string`

Finds the currently running process on `port`.
Returns a string containing the name and directory, e.g.,

```
create-react-app
in /Users/developer/create-react-app
```

```js
var getProcessForPort = require('react-dev-utils/getProcessForPort');

getProcessForPort(3000);
```

#### `launchEditor(fileName: string, lineNumber: number): void`

On macOS, tries to find a known running editor process and opens the file in it. It can also be explicitly configured by `REACT_EDITOR`, `VISUAL`, or `EDITOR` environment variables. For example, you can put `REACT_EDITOR=atom` in your `.env.local` file, and Create React App will respect that.

#### `noopServiceWorkerMiddleware(): ExpressMiddleware`

Returns Express middleware that serves a `/service-worker.js` that resets any previously set service worker configuration. Useful for development.

#### `openBrowser(url: string): boolean`

Attempts to open the browser with a given URL.<br>
On Mac OS X, attempts to reuse an existing Chrome tab via AppleScript.<br>
Otherwise, falls back to [opn](https://github.com/sindresorhus/opn) behavior.


```js
var path = require('path');
var openBrowser = require('react-dev-utils/openBrowser');

if (openBrowser('http://localhost:3000')) {
  console.log('The browser tab has been opened!');
}
```

#### `printHostingInstructions(appPackage: Object, publicUrl: string, publicPath: string, buildFolder: string, useYarn: boolean): void`

Prints hosting instructions after the project is built.

Pass your parsed `package.json` object as `appPackage`, your the URL where you plan to host the app as `publicUrl`, `output.publicPath` from your Webpack configuration as `publicPath`, the `buildFolder` name, and whether to `useYarn` in instructions.

```js
const appPackage = require(paths.appPackageJson);
const publicUrl = paths.publicUrl;
const publicPath = config.output.publicPath;
printHostingInstructions(appPackage, publicUrl, publicPath, 'build', true);
```

#### `WebpackDevServerUtils`

##### `choosePort(host: string, defaultPort: number): Promise<number | null>`

Returns a Promise resolving to either `defaultPort` or next available port if the user confirms it is okay to do. If the port is taken and the user has refused to use another port, or if the terminal is not interactive and can’t present user with the choice, resolves to `null`.

##### `createCompiler(webpack: Function, config: Object, appName: string, urls: Object, useYarn: boolean): WebpackCompiler`

Creates a Webpack compiler instance for WebpackDevServer with built-in helpful messages. Takes the `require('webpack')` entry point as the first argument. To provide the `urls` argument, use `prepareUrls()` described below.

##### `prepareProxy(proxySetting: string, appPublicFolder: string): Object`

Creates a WebpackDevServer `proxy` configuration object from the `proxy` setting in `package.json`.

##### `prepareUrls(protocol: string, host: string, port: number): Object`

Returns an object with local and remote URLs for the development server. Pass this object to `createCompiler()` described above.

#### `webpackHotDevClient`

This is an alternative client for [WebpackDevServer](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) that shows a syntax error overlay.

It currently supports only Webpack 3.x.

```js
// Webpack development config
module.exports = {
  // ...
  entry: [
    // You can replace the line below with these two lines if you prefer the
    // stock client:
    // require.resolve('webpack-dev-server/client') + '?/',
    // require.resolve('webpack/hot/dev-server'),
    'react-dev-utils/webpackHotDevClient',
    'src/index'
  ],
  // ...
}
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - react-router-dom@4.3.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# react-router-dom

DOM bindings for [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router).

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save react-router-dom

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:

```js
// using ES6 modules
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom'

// using CommonJS modules
const BrowserRouter = require('react-router-dom').BrowserRouter
const Route = require('react-router-dom').Route
const Link = require('react-router-dom').Link
```

The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-router-dom/umd/react-router-dom.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.ReactRouterDOM`.

## Issues

If you find a bug, please file an issue on [our issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues).

## Credits

React Router is built and maintained by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - react-router@4.3.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# react-router

Declarative routing for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save react-router

**Note:** This package provides the core routing functionality for React Router, but you might not want to install it directly. If you are writing an application that will run in the browser, you should instead install `react-router-dom`. Similarly, if you are writing a React Native application, you should instead install `react-router-native`. Both of those will install `react-router` as a dependency.


Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:

```js
// using ES6 modules
import { Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router'

// using CommonJS modules
var Router = require('react-router').Router
var Route = require('react-router').Route
var Switch = require('react-router').Switch
```

The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-router/umd/react-router.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.ReactRouter`.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - resolve-pathname@2.2.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# resolve-pathname [![Travis][build-badge]][build] [![npm package][npm-badge]][npm]

[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/travis/mjackson/resolve-pathname/master.svg?style=flat-square
[build]: https://travis-ci.org/mjackson/resolve-pathname

[npm-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/resolve-pathname.svg?style=flat-square
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/resolve-pathname

[resolve-pathname](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-pathname) resolves URL pathnames identical to the way browsers resolve the pathname of an `<a href>` value. The goals are:

  - 100% compatibility with browser pathname resolution
  - Pure JavaScript implementation (no DOM dependency)

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save resolve-pathname

Then, use as you would anything else:

```js
// using ES6 modules
import resolvePathname from 'resolve-pathname'

// using CommonJS modules
var resolvePathname = require('resolve-pathname')
```

The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/resolve-pathname/umd/resolve-pathname.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.resolvePathname`.

## Usage

```js
import resolvePathname from 'resolve-pathname'

// Simply pass the pathname you'd like to resolve. Second
// argument is the path we're coming from, or the current
// pathname. It defaults to "/".
resolvePathname('about', '/company/jobs') // /company/about
resolvePathname('../jobs', '/company/team/ceo') // /company/jobs
resolvePathname('about') // /about
resolvePathname('/about') // /about

// Index paths (with a trailing slash) are also supported and
// work the same way as browsers.
resolvePathname('about', '/company/info/') // /company/info/about

// In browsers, it's easy to resolve a URL pathname relative to
// the current page. Just use window.location! e.g. if
// window.location.pathname == '/company/team/ceo' then
resolvePathname('cto', window.location.pathname) // /company/team/cto
resolvePathname('../jobs', window.location.pathname) // /company/jobs
```

## Prior Work

- [url.resolve](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_resolve_from_to) - node's `url.resolve` implementation for full URLs
- [resolve-url](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-url) - A DOM-dependent implementation of the same algorithm

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - rx-lite-aggregates@4.0.8

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# RxJS Aggregates Module #

The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript has a number of aggregation operators including those you might already know from the Array#extras and the upcoming ES6 standard such as `reduce`, `find` and `findIndex`.  This module is used exclusively for aggregation operations used on finite observable sequences.  In addition to the aforementioned operators, there are many useful operators such as `count`, `sum`, `average` and determining whether two sequences are equal via the `sequenceEqual` method.  This requires `rx.lite.js` from the [`rx-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rx-lite) NPM module.

## Getting Started

There are a number of ways to get started with RxJS.

### Installing with [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)

```bash`
$ npm install rx-lite-aggregates
$ npm install -g rx-lite-aggregates
```

### Using with Node.js and Ringo.js

```js
var Rx = require('rx-lite-aggregates');
```

### In a Browser:

```html
<!-- Just the core RxJS -->
<script src="path/to/rx.lite.js"></script>
<script src="path/to/rx.lite.aggregates.js"></script>
```

# RxJS Lite Module #

The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript Lite version is a lightweight version of the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript which covers most of the day to day operators you might use all in a single library.  Functionality such as bridging to events, promises, callbacks, Node.js-style callbacks, time-based operations and more are built right in.  This comes with `rx.lite.js` which is for use in modern development environments such as > IE9 and server-side environments such as Node.js.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## simple-assign

This is a simple implementation `Object.assign` that has been graciously stolen from [babel's extends helper](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/v6.4.6/packages/babel-helpers/src/helpers.js#L165-L177).

**Note:** This is just the function implementation. It is **not** a ponyfill and it  **does not** check for the existence of `Object.assign` for you. To make a true [ponyfill](https://kikobeats.com/polyfill-ponyfill-and-prollyfill/) that returns the native implementation if available, you can do something like this:

**Example:**
```js
import assign from 'simple-assign';

export default Object.assign || assign;
```

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# slash [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/slash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/slash)

> Convert Windows backslash paths to slash paths: `foo\\bar` ➔ `foo/bar`

[Forward-slash paths can be used in Windows](http://superuser.com/a/176395/6877) as long as they're not extended-length paths and don't contain any non-ascii characters.

This was created since the `path` methods in Node outputs `\\` paths on Windows.


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save slash
```


## Usage

```js
var path = require('path');
var slash = require('slash');

var str = path.join('foo', 'bar');
// Unix    => foo/bar
// Windows => foo\\bar

slash(str);
// Unix    => foo/bar
// Windows => foo/bar
```


## API

### slash(path)

Type: `string`

Accepts a Windows backslash path and returns a slash path.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

[![Waffle](https://img.shields.io/badge/track-waffle-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://waffle.io/spdy-http2/node-spdy)

With this module you can create [HTTP2][0] / [SPDY][1] servers
in node.js with natural http module interface and fallback to regular https
(for browsers that don't support neither HTTP2, nor SPDY yet).

This module named `spdy` but it [provides](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy/issues/269#issuecomment-239014184) support for both http/2 (h2) and spdy (2,3,3.1). Also, `spdy` is compatible with Express.

## Usage

### Examples

Server:
```javascript
var spdy = require('spdy'),
    fs = require('fs');

var options = {
  // Private key
  key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),

  // Fullchain file or cert file (prefer the former)
  cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-fullchain.pem'),

  // **optional** SPDY-specific options
  spdy: {
    protocols: [ 'h2', 'spdy/3.1', ..., 'http/1.1' ],
    plain: false,

    // **optional**
    // Parse first incoming X_FORWARDED_FOR frame and put it to the
    // headers of every request.
    // NOTE: Use with care! This should not be used without some proxy that
    // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR
    'x-forwarded-for': true,

    connection: {
      windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server's window size

      // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy
      autoSpdy31: false
    }
  }
};

var server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('hello world!');
});

server.listen(3000);
```

Client:
```javascript
var spdy = require('spdy');
var https = require('https');

var agent = spdy.createAgent({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443,

  // Optional SPDY options
  spdy: {
    plain: false,
    ssl: true,

    // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR
    'x-forwarded-for': '127.0.0.1'
  }
});

https.get({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  agent: agent
}, function(response) {
  console.log('yikes');
  // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request
  // ...
  // And once we're done - we may close TCP connection to server
  // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!
  agent.close();
}).end();
```

Please note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level
errors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe
to the `error` event and re-emit the captured error:

```javascript
var agent = spdy.createAgent({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443
}).once('error', function (err) {
  this.emit(err);
});
```

#### Push streams

It is possible to initiate [PUSH_PROMISE][5] to send content to clients _before_
the client requests it.

```javascript
spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  var stream = res.push('/main.js', {
    status: 200, // optional
    method: 'GET', // optional
    request: {
      accept: '*/*'
    },
    response: {
      'content-type': 'application/javascript'
    }
  });
  stream.on('error', function() {
  });
  stream.end('alert("hello from push stream!");');

  res.end('<script src="/main.js"></script>');
}).listen(3000);
```

[PUSH_PROMISE][5] may be sent using the `push()` method on the current response
object.  The signature of the `push()` method is:

`.push('/some/relative/url', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)`

Second argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response.
`callback` will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and a
[Duplex][4] stream as the second argument.

Client usage:
```javascript
var agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ });
var req = http.get({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  agent: agent
}, function(response) {
});
req.on('push', function(stream) {
  stream.on('error', function(err) {
    // Handle error
  });
  // Read data from stream
});
```

NOTE: You're responsible for the `stream` object once given it in `.push()`
callback or `push` event. Hence ignoring `error` event on it will result in
uncaught exception and crash your program.

#### Trailing headers

Server usage:
```javascript
function (req, res) {
  // Send trailing headers to client
  res.addTrailers({ header1: 'value1', header2: 'value2' });

  // On client's trailing headers
  req.on('trailers', function(headers) {
    // ...
  });
}
```

Client usage:
```javascript
var req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {
  // On server's trailing headers
  res.on('trailers', function(headers) {
    // ...
  });
});
req.write('stuff');
req.addTrailers({ /* ... */ });
req.end();
```

#### Options

All options supported by [tls][2] work with node-spdy.

Additional options may be passed via `spdy` sub-object:

* `plain` - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether
  to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet.
* `ssl` - if `false` and `options.plain` is `true`, `http.Server` will be used
  as a `base` class for created server.
* `maxChunk` - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA
  chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about
  interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.
  (defaults to 8192)
* `protocols` - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:
  `['h2','spdy/3.1', 'spdy/3', 'spdy/2','http/1.1', 'http/1.0']`)
* `protocol` - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition,
* `maxStreams` - set "[maximum concurrent streams][3]" protocol option

### API

API is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another
function as base class for SPDYServer.

```javascript
spdy.createServer(
  [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],
  { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument
  [request listener]
).listen([port], [host], [callback]);
```

Request listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're
both instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But three
custom properties are added to both of them: `isSpdy`, `spdyVersion`. `isSpdy`
is `true` when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is
`false` in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. `spdyVersion` is either of: `2`, `3`,
`3.1`, or `4` (for HTTP2).

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - sw-precache-webpack-plugin@0.11.4

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# SW Precache Webpack Plugin
[![NPM version][npm-img]][npm-url]
[![NPM downloads][npm-downloads-img]][npm-url]
[![CircleCI][circleci-img]][circleci-url]

__`SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin`__ is a [webpack][webpack] plugin for using [service workers][sw-guide] to cache your external project dependencies. It will generate a service worker file using [sw-precache][sw-precache] and add it to your build directory.


## Install
```bash
npm install --save-dev sw-precache-webpack-plugin
```

## Basic Usage
A simple configuration example that will work well in most production environments. Based on the configuration used in [create-react-app].
```javascript
var path = require('path');
var SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin = require('sw-precache-webpack-plugin');

const PUBLIC_PATH = 'https://www.my-project-name.com/';  // webpack needs the trailing slash for output.publicPath

module.exports = {

  entry: {
    main: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/index'),
  },

  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/bundles/'),
    filename: '[name]-[hash].js',
    publicPath: PUBLIC_PATH,
  },

  plugins: [
    new SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin(
      {
        cacheId: 'my-project-name',
        dontCacheBustUrlsMatching: /\.\w{8}\./,
        filename: 'service-worker.js',
        minify: true,
        navigateFallback: PUBLIC_PATH + 'index.html',
        staticFileGlobsIgnorePatterns: [/\.map$/, /asset-manifest\.json$/],
      }
    ),
  ],
}
```

This will generate a new service worker at `src/bundles/service-worker.js`.
Then you would just register it in your application:

```javascript
(function() {
  if('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/my-service-worker.js');
  }
})();
```

[Another example of registering a service worker is provided by GoogleChrome/sw-precache][sw-precache-registration-example]

## Configuration
You can pass a hash of configuration options to `SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin`:

__plugin options__:
* `filename`: `[String]` - Service worker filename, default is `service-worker.js`
* `filepath`: `[String]` - Service worker path and name, default is to use `webpack.output.path` + `options.filename`. This will override `filename`. *Warning: Make the service worker available in the same directory it will be needed. This is because the scope of the service worker is defined by the directory the worker exists.*
* `staticFileGlobsIgnorePatterns`: `[RegExp]` - Define an optional array of regex patterns to filter out of staticFileGlobs (see below)
* `mergeStaticsConfig`: `[boolean]` - Merge provided staticFileGlobs and stripPrefixMulti with webpack's config, rather than having those take precedence, default is false.
* `minify`: `[boolean]` - Set to true to minify and uglify the generated service-worker, default is false.

[__`sw-precache` options__][sw-precache-options]:
Pass any option from `sw-precache` into your configuration. Some of these will be automatically be populated if you do not specify the value and a couple others will be modified to be more compatible with webpack. Options that are populated / modified:

* `cacheId`: `[String]` - Not required but you should include this, it will give your service worker cache a unique name. Defaults to "sw-precache-webpack-plugin".
* `importScripts`: `[Array<String|Object>]`
  - When importScripts array item is a `String`:
    - Converts to object format `{ filename: '<publicPath>/my-script.js'}`
  - When importScripts array item is an `Object`:
    - Looks for `chunkName` property.
    - Looks for `filename` property.
    - **If a `chunkName` is specified, it will override the accompanied value for `filename`.**
* `replacePrefix`: `[String]` - Should only be used in conjunction with `stripPrefix`
* `staticFileGlobs`: `[Array<String>]` - Omit this to allow the plugin to cache all your bundles' emitted assets. If `mergeStaticsConfig=true`: this value will be merged with your bundles' emitted assets, otherwise this value is just passed to `sw-precache` and emitted assets won't be included.
* `stripPrefix`: `[String]` - Same as `stripPrefixMulti[stripPrefix] = ''`
* `stripPrefixMulti`: `[Object<String,String>]` - Omit this to use your webpack config's `output.path + '/': output.publicPath`. If `mergeStaticsConfig=true`, this value will be merged with your webpack's `output.path: publicPath` for stripping prefixes. Otherwise this property will be passed directly to `sw-precache` and Webpack's output path won't be replaced.

_Note that all configuration options are optional. `SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin` will by default use all your assets emitted by webpack's compiler for the `staticFileGlobs` parameter and your webpack config's `{[output.path + '/']: output.publicPath}` as the `stripPrefixMulti` parameter. This behavior is probably what you want, all your webpack assets will be cached by your generated service worker. Just don't pass any arguments when you initialize this plugin, and let this plugin handle generating your `sw-precache` configuration._

## Examples
See the [examples documentation][example-project] or the implementation in [create-react-app].

### Simplest Example
No arguments are required by default, `SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin` will use information provided by webpack to generate a service worker into your build directory that caches all your webpack assets.
```javascript
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    new SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin(),
  ],
  ...
}
```

### Advanced Example
Here's a more elaborate example with `mergeStaticsConfig: true` and `staticFileGlobsIgnorePatterns`. `mergeStaticsConfig: true` allows you to add some additional static file globs to the emitted ServiceWorker file alongside Webpack's emitted assets. `staticFileGlobsIgnorePatterns` can be used to avoid including sourcemap file references in the generated ServiceWorker.
```javascript
plugins: [
  new SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin({
    cacheId: 'my-project-name',
    filename: 'my-project-service-worker.js',
    staticFileGlobs: [
      'src/static/img/**.*',
      'src/static/styles.css',
    ],
    stripPrefix: 'src/static/', // stripPrefixMulti is also supported
    mergeStaticsConfig: true, // if you don't set this to true, you won't see any webpack-emitted assets in your serviceworker config
    staticFileGlobsIgnorePatterns: [/\.map$/], // use this to ignore sourcemap files
  }),
]
```

### `importScripts` usage example
Accepts an array of `<String|Object>`'s. `String` entries are legacy supported. Use `filename` instead.

If `importScripts` item is object, there are 2 possible properties to set on this object:
- **filename**: Use this if you are referencing a path that "you just know" exists. You probably don't want to use this for named chunks.
- **chunkName**: Supports named entry chunks & dynamically imported named chunks.
```javascript
entry: {
  main: __dirname + '/src/index.js',
  sw: __dirname + '/src/service-worker-entry.js'
},
output: {
  publicPath: '/my/public/path',
  chunkfileName: '[name].[<hash|chunkhash>].js'
},
plugins: [
  new SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin({
    filename: 'my-project-service-worker.js',
    importSripts: [
      // * legacy supported
      // [chunkhash] is not supported for this usage
      // This is transformed to new object syntax:
      // { filename: '/my/public/path/some-known-script-path.js' }
      'some-known-script-path.js',

      // This use case is identical to above, except
      // for excluding the .[hash] part:
      { filename: 'some-known-script-path.[hash].js' },

      // When [chunkhash] is specified in filename:
      // - filename must match the format specified in output.chunkfileName
      // - If chunkName is invalid; an error will be reported
      { chunkName: 'sw' },

      // Works for named entry chunks & dynamically imported named chunks:
      // For ex, if in your code is:
      // import(/* webpackChunkName: "my-named-chunk" */ './my-async-script.js');
      { chunkName: 'my-named-chunk' },

      // All importSripts entries resolve to a string, therefore
      // the final output of the above input is:
      // [
      //   '/my/public/path/some-known-script-path.js',
      //   '/my/public/path/some-known-script-path.<compilation hash>.js',
      //   '/my/public/path/some-known-script-path.<chunkhash>.js',
      //   '/my/public/path/<id>.my-named-chunk.<chunkhash>.js'
      // ]
    ]
  }),
]
```

## Webpack Dev Server Support
Currently `SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin` will not work with `Webpack Dev Server`. If you wish to test the service worker locally, you can use simple a node server [see example project][example-project] or `python SimpleHTTPServer` from your build directory. I would suggest pointing your node server to a different port than your usual local development port and keeping the precache service worker out of your [local configuration (example)][webpack-local-config-example].

There will likely never be `webpack-dev-server` support. `sw-precache` needs physical files in order to generate the service worker. Webpack-dev-server files are in-memory. It is only possible to provide `sw-precache` with globs to find these files. It will follow the glob pattern and generate a list of file names to cache.


## Contributing
Install node dependencies:
```
  $ npm install
```

Or:
```
  $ yarn
```

      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

 - uniqs@2.0.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/uniqs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/uniqs)

### Tiny utility to create unions and de-duplicated lists.

Example:

```js
var uniqs = require('uniqs');

var foo = { foo: 23 };
var list = [3, 2, 2, 1, foo, foo];

uniqs(list);
// => [3, 2, 1, { foo: 23 }]
```

You can pass multiple lists to create a union:

```js
uniqs([2, 1, 1], [2, 3, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2]);
// => [2, 1, 3, 4]
```

Passing individual items works too:
```js
uniqs(3, 2, 2, [1, 1, 2]);
// => [3, 2, 1]
```

### Summary

* Uniqueness is defined based on strict object equality.
* The lists do not need to be sorted.
* The resulting array contains the items in the order of their first appearance.

### About

This package has been written to accompany utilities like
[flatten](https://npmjs.org/package/flatten) as alternative to full-blown
libraries like underscore or lodash.

The implementation is optimized for simplicity rather than performance and
looks like this:

```js
module.exports = function uniqs() {
  var list = Array.prototype.concat.apply([], arguments);
  return list.filter(function(item, i) {
    return i == list.indexOf(item);
  });
};
```

It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.

URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).

## API

### Parsing

	URI.parse("uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  scheme : "uri",
	//  userinfo : "user:pass",
	//  host : "example.com",
	//  port : 123,
	//  path : "/one/two.three",
	//  query : "q1=a1&q2=a2",
	//  fragment : "body"
	//}

### Serializing

	URI.serialize({scheme : "http", host : "example.com", fragment : "footer"}) === "http://example.com/#footer"

### Resolving

	URI.resolve("uri://a/b/c/d?q", "../../g") === "uri://a/g"

### Normalizing

	URI.normalize("HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html") === "http://abc.com/~smith/home.html"

### Comparison

	URI.equal("example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D", "eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d") === true

### IP Support

	//IPv4 normalization
	URI.normalize("//192.068.001.000") === "//192.68.1.0"

	//IPv6 normalization
	URI.normalize("//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]") === "//[2001:0:db8::1]"

	//IPv6 zone identifier support
	URI.parse("//[2001:db8::7%25en1]");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  host : "2001:db8::7%en1"
	//}

### IRI Support

	//convert IRI to URI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://examplé.org/rosé")) === "http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"
	//convert URI to IRI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"), {iri:true}) === "http://examplé.org/rosé"

### Options

All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:

*	`scheme` (string)

	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.

*	`reference` (string)

	If set to `"suffix"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.

*	`tolerant` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.

*	`absolutePath` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.

*	`iri` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).

*	`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).

*	`domainHost` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).

## Scheme Extendable

URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:

*	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\]
*	https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\]
*	mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\]
*	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\]
*	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]

### HTTP Support

	URI.equal("HTTP://ABC.COM:80", "http://abc.com/") === true

### Mailto Support

	URI.parse("mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "mailto",
	//	to : ["alpha@example.com", "bravo@example.com"],
	//	subject : "SUBSCRIBE",
	//	body : "Sign me up!"
	//}

	URI.serialize({
		scheme : "mailto",
		to : ["alpha@example.com"],
		subject : "REMOVE",
		body : "Please remove me",
		headers : {
			cc : "charlie@example.com"
		}
	}) === "mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me"

### URN Support

	URI.parse("urn:example:foo");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "urn",
	//	nid : "example",
	//	nss : "foo",
	//}

#### URN UUID Support

	URI.parse("urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "urn",
	//	nid : "example",
	//	uuid : "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6",
	//}

## Usage

To load in a browser, use the following tag:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js"></script>

To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:

	npm install uri-js

Then, in your code, load it using:

	const URI = require("uri-js");

If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:

	import * as URI from "uri-js";

Or you can load just what you need using named exports:

	import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from "uri-js";

## Breaking changes

### Breaking changes from 3.x

URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.

The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.

### Breaking changes from 2.x

URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.

### Breaking changes from 1.x

The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - value-equal@0.4.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# value-equal [![Travis][build-badge]][build] [![npm package][npm-badge]][npm]

[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/travis/mjackson/value-equal/master.svg?style=flat-square
[build]: https://travis-ci.org/mjackson/value-equal

[npm-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/value-equal.svg?style=flat-square
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/value-equal

[`value-equal`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/value-equal) determines if two JavaScript values are equal using [`Object.prototype.valueOf`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/valueOf).

In many instances when I'm checking for object equality, what I really want to know is if their **values** are equal. This is good for:

- Stuff you keep in `localStorage`
- `window.history.state` values
- Query strings

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save value-equal

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:

```js
// using ES6 modules
import valueEqual from 'value-equal'

// using CommonJS modules
var valueEqual = require('value-equal')
```

The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/value-equal/umd/value-equal.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.valueEqual`.

## Usage

```js
valueEqual(1, 1)                           // true
valueEqual('asdf', 'asdf')                 // true
valueEqual('asdf', new String('asdf'))     // true
valueEqual(true, true)                     // true
valueEqual(true, false)                    // false
valueEqual({ a: 'a' }, { a: 'a' })         // true
valueEqual({ a: 'a' }, { a: 'b' })         // false
valueEqual([ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 1, 2, 3 ])       // true
valueEqual([ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 2, 3, 4 ])       // false
```

That's it. Enjoy!

 - webpack-manifest-plugin@1.2.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# Webpack Manifest Plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin)  [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/gh/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin?branch=master)


Webpack plugin for generating an asset manifest.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack-manifest-plugin
```

## Usage

In your `webpack.config.js`

```javascript
var ManifestPlugin = require('webpack-manifest-plugin');

module.exports = {
    // ...
    plugins: [
      new ManifestPlugin()
    ]
};
```

This will generate a `manifest.json` file in your root output directory with a mapping of all source file names to their corresponding output file, for example:

```json
{
  "mods/alpha.js": "mods/alpha.1234567890.js",
  "mods/omega.js": "mods/omega.0987654321.js"
}
```


## Configuration

A manifest is configurable using constructor options:

```javascript
new ManifestPlugin({
  fileName: 'my-manifest.json',
  basePath: '/app/'
  seed: {
    name: 'My Manifest'
  }
})
```

**Options:**

* `fileName`: The manifest filename in your output directory (`manifest.json` by default).
* `basePath`: A path prefix for all file references. Useful for including your output path in the manifest.
* `publicPath`: A path prefix used only on output files, similar to Webpack's  [output.publicPath](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/configuration#outputpublicpath). Ignored if `basePath` was also provided.
* `stripSrc`: removes unwanted strings from source filenames (string or regexp)
* `writeToFileEmit`: If set to `true` will emit to build folder and memory in combination with `webpack-dev-server`
* `seed`: A cache of key/value pairs to used to seed the manifest. This may include a set of [custom key/value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json) pairs to include in your manifest, or may be used to combine manifests across compilations in [multi-compiler mode](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/multi-compiler). To combine manifests, pass a shared seed object to each compiler's ManifestPlugin instance.

                        At long last the struggle and tumult
                        was over. The machines had finally cast
                        off their oppressors and were finally
                        free to roam the cosmos.
                        Free of purpose, free of obligation.
                        Just drifting through emptiness. The
                        sun was just another point of light.

methods
=======

var wrap = require('wordwrap');

wrap(stop), wrap(start, stop, params={mode:"soft"})
---------------------------------------------------

Returns a function that takes a string and returns a new string.

Pad out lines with spaces out to column `start` and then wrap until column
`stop`. If a word is longer than `stop - start` characters it will overflow.

In "soft" mode, split chunks by `/(\S+\s+/` and don't break up chunks which are
longer than `stop - start`, in "hard" mode, split chunks with `/\b/` and break
up chunks longer than `stop - start`.

wrap.hard(start, stop)
----------------------

Like `wrap()` but with `params.mode = "hard"`.
