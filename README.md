# PlugSonic-sample

PlugSonic Sample is a simple web application to edit sound files and apply audio effects directly in the browser, developed using standard web technologies including React and the Web Audio API.

This application has been developed by the Audio Experience Design team at Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/research/audio-experience-design/) within the EU-funded PLUGGY research project (https://www.pluggy-project.eu/).

PLUGGY provides the instruments needed to create, process and experience 3D soundscapes and sonic narratives without the need for specific devices, external tools (software and/or hardware), specialised knowledge or custom development.
